# Good morning, friends!

<br>
We released [Selenide 6.6.0](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/milestone/152?closed=1).


### Added new Selenide plugin `selenide-clear-with-shortcut`

In Selenide 6.5.0, we changed the implementation of `$.clear()` method from a standard WebDriver to a shortcut ("Select all" -> "Delete").  
Later we realized this shortcut didn't work stably in all browsers, we had to rework it. It got more stable, but slower. 
And since it's not really needed for all, we decided to return the old good `WebElement.clear()`.

And if you need the _smart_ `$.clean()` method with shortcuts - you can add the brand new Selenide plugin:

```groovy
  testImplementation('com.codeborne:selenide:6.6.0')
  testImplementation('com.codeborne:selenide-clear-with-shortcut:6.6.0')
```

Dependency `com.codeborne:selenide-clear-with-shortcut` will override method `$.clear()` - and `$.setValue()` correspondingly.

See [issue 1497](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1497), [PR 1847](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1847) and [PR 1838](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1838).

### Fix method `$.clear()` in Safari

We found that new `$.clear()` didn't work in Safari browser (who uses it nowadays?).   
I hope we fixed it. :) 

See [issue 1819](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1819) and [PR 1820](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1820).

<br>

### New checks for element own text

Added two new checks for element's own text:

* `$("#child_div1").shouldHave(ownTextCaseSensitive("Son"));`
* `$("#child_div1").shouldHave(exactOwnTextCaseSensitive("Son"))`

Thanks to [Kachurin Alexandr](https://github.com/kachurinaa) for 
[PR 1811](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1811) and [PR 1812](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1812).

### Added method `$.click()` with timeout

By default, method `$.click()` has the standard Selenide timeout (which is initially 4 seconds).  
Sometimes it's not enough - for example:
1. if clicking a link opens a new page which loads longer than 4 seconds.
2. if the element which we are going to click is not visible yet, and appears after more than 4 seconds. 

In this release, we added timeout parameter to method `$.click`:

```java
  $("#slow-link").click(usingDefaultMethod().timeout(ofSeconds(8)));
  $("#slow-link").click(usingJavaScript().timeout(ofSeconds(8)));
```

Though, it solves only the first problem. In next release we will also solve the second. :)

See [issue 1572](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1572) and [PR 1845](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1845).

<br>

### Added timeout to methods `confirm()`, `dismiss()` и `prompt()`

These methods existed from the very beginning of Selenide era. They allow working with JavaScript modal dialogs (`alert`, `confirm`, `prompt`).
For example:
```java
confirm();
confirm("Are you sure you want to delete all files?");
```

But they could not have any other timeout except the default one.
Now you can pass a timeout parameter:
```java
confirm(withTimeout(ofSeconds(2)));
confirm(withExpectedText("Are you sure?").timeout(ofSeconds(2)));
```
See [issue 1721](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1721) and [PR 1846](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1846).

<br>

### Fixed method `Driver.executeJavaScript()`

...to support a wrapped webdriver (i.e. when you have added some listeners to the webdriver).

See [PR 1848](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1848).

<br>

### Fixed phrasing of some checks
... to sound correctly in English. Namely:

| In a test             | Was in report            | Now in report               |
|-----------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|
| `$.should(appear)`    | "Element should visible" | "Element should be visible" |
| `$.should(disappear)` | "Element should hidden"  | "Element should be hidden"  |


See [PR 1840](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1840).

### Restored Safari options

We realized that after upgrading to Selenium 4, we lost most of Safari options.  
It was easy to fix, yet... why nobody did complain on it?

Looks like nobody is using Safari... :)

See [issue 1836](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1836) and [PR 1841](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1841).

<br>

### Fixed soft asserts in TestNG

After upgrading to TestNG 7.5, Selenide soft asserts didn't work anymore. If some check failed, your tests still remained green. 

We had to downgrade to TestNG 7.4.0 and hope for the fix on the dark side. :)

See [issue 1834](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1834) and [PR 1843](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1843).

### Upgraded dependencies

* Selenium [4.1.4 -> 4.2.1](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/trunk/java/CHANGELOG).
* WebDriverManager [5.1.1 -> 5.2.0](https://github.com/bonigarcia/webdrivermanager/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

### Statistics

We haven't published Selenide download statistics for a long time:

We're almost back to our all-time high of 324k downloads in May.

<br>

Stay tuned!
