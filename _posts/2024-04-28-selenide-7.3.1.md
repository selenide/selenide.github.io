Good morning!

We released [Selenide 7.3.1](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/milestone/205?closed=1).  

It's a tiny release, so it will be easy to upgrade. Let's start the unboxing:

* [Mock response with specific content type](#mock-specific-content-type)
* [Fixed method `$.clear()` in mobile](#fix-clear-in-appium)
* [Fixed error message when clicking an invalid link](#fix-error-message-for-invalid-link)
* [Disabled Chrome warning about stolen password](#disable-warning-about-stolen-password)
* [Fix CDP downloading for custom webdrivers](#fix-cdp-download-for-custom-webdrivers)
* [Deprecated setting `holdBrowserOpen`](#deprecate-setting-hold-browser-open)
* [Upgraded Selenium from 4.19.1 to 4.20.0](#upgrade-to-selenium-4.20.0)
* [Statistics](#statistics)

### Mock response with specific content type {#mock-specific-content-type}

As you know, Selenide allows to [mock server response](/2022/10/07/selenide-6.9.0/#proxy-mock-response) using its built-in proxy server:
```java
getSelenideProxy().responseMocker().mockText("cik-mock",
  urlStartsWith(GET, "https://cik.ru/api/gov/no/referendum"), 
  () -> "{votes: 2133326, for: 99.23, against: 0.77}");
```

You could specify any response content, _but not type_. But sometimes the type is important. 
Now you can specify any headers for the mocked server response, including `Content-Type`:
```java
import org.openqa.selenium.remote.http.HttpResponse;

getSelenideProxy().proxyMocker().mockResponse("cik-mock", 
  urlStartsWith(GET, "https://cik.ru/api/gov/no/referendum"), () -> new HttpResponse()
      .setStatus(429)
      .addHeader("Content-Type", "application/json")
      .setContent(utf8String("{votes: 2133326, for: 99.23, against: 0.77}"))
  );
```

See [issue 2705](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/2705) and [PR 2706](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2706).

### Fixed method `$.clear()` in mobile {#fix-clear-in-appium}
... for an element that exists in DOM, but not visible (or interactable). 

It turns out that calling `clear` or `click` on mobile apps:
```java
$("#hiddenElement").clear();
```

Failed with an incorrect message if the element is found, but not visible (for example, covered by another element):
```java
Element should be interactable {By.name: ComputeSumButton}
Element: '<XCUIElementTypeButton ... visible="false">...

Caused by: 
  UnsupportedCommandException: 
    Unhandled endpoint: /session/28...13/element/07000000-0000-0000-CF35-000000000000/css/opacity ...
```

Now the message will be correct, without any `UnsupportedCommandException`:
```java
Element should be visible {By.name: ComputeSumButton}
```

See [issue 2722](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/2722) and [PR 2723](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2723).

### Fixed error message when clicking an invalid link {#fix-error-message-for-invalid-link}

A similar problem. If you try to click an invalid link in Firefox (for example, `https://zopa`):
```java
  $("#invalid-link")
    .shouldHave(attribute("href", "https://zopa"))
    .click();
```

then Selenide generated an misleading error message:
```java
Element not found {#link}
Expected: clickable: interactable and enabled
```

Now there will be an honest error text:
```java
WebDriverException: Reached error page: about:neterror?e=dnsNotFound&u=https%3A//zopa/
                    Build info: version: '4.20.0', revision: '866c76ca80'
```

P.S. Interestingly, only Firefox produces this error. Other browsers calmly display a standard page with a text like this:
```
This site canâ€™t be reached
Check if there is a typo in example.
DNS_PROBE_FINISHED_NXDOMAIN
```

See [issue 2725](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/2725) and [PR 2727](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2727).

### Disabled Chrome warning about stolen password {#disable-warning-about-stolen-password}

Again. We already disabled this annoying prompt in [PR 2662](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2662), but there
we added only setting `profile.password_manager_enabled=false` which was not enough. Now we also added
setting `profile.password_manager_leak_detection=false`.

See [PR 2729](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2729).

<br>

### Fix CDP downloading for custom webdrivers {#fix-cdp-download-for-custom-webdrivers}

As you remember, few months ago we implemented another file downloading mechanism via CDP. 
Obviously, it works only in Chromium-based browsers. 

But in case of custom webdrivers, the check "is this a Chromium" didn't work:
```java
Configuration.fileDownload = CDP;
Configuration.browser = MyCustomChromedriverFactory.class.getName();

File report = $("#report").download();
// threw an error: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: 
// The browser you selected "MyTest$CustomWebDriverProvider" doesn't have Chrome Devtools protocol functionality.
```

Now Selenide properly detected Chromium-based browser using their actual capabilities.

Thanks [Petr Ovcharenko](https://github.com/PetroOv) for [PR 2728](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2728).

### Deprecated setting `holdBrowserOpen` {#deprecate-setting-hold-browser-open}

Selenide has setting `holdBrowserOpen`: when set to `true`, Selenide will not close the browser after finishing the tests.
Sometimes people want to leave the browser opened to debug/investigate there something. 

I personally never liked this feature, and now we've got a good reason to remove it.
Suddenly we realized that the feature is harmful. When you finish the debugging and manually close the browser, 
nobody closes the webdriver. It will be hanging and consuming resources indefinitely.

Now flag `holdBrowserOpen` is deprecated. As a replacement, you can just add `sleep(600_000)` in your test - and the browser will stay opened for a long time.

See [PR 2730](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2730).

### Upgraded Selenium from 4.19.1 to 4.20.0 {#upgrade-to-selenium-4.20.0}

I don't see too much changes in [Selenium changelog](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/trunk/java/CHANGELOG), so nothing to fear. :) 
Among others, they added CDP 124 and removed 121. 

See [PR 2726](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2726).
