Hi all!

We have published one more mini-release [Selenide 5.12.2](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/milestone/99?closed=1).
  

## Fixed annotations @Nonnull
 
 ... for some of `SelenideElement` methods.

After upgrading to Selenide 5.12.0 some Kotlin users started getting compilation errors in their projects.   
It's because we marked all methods of `SelenideElement` with annotations `@Nullable`/`@Nonnull`, and Kotlin is sensible to them.  

For the following methods we now changed `@Nullable` annotation to `@Nonnull` (because they never return null):
* `$.getText()`
* `$.text()`
* `$.innerText()`
* `$.innerHtml()`
* `$.getSelectedText()`

Now you can again put results of those methods to non-nullable variables (thought such constructs seem to me a bit strange in tests).    

See [issue 1179](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1179) and [PR 1181](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1181).

## Fixed setting `holdBrowserOpen=true` 

This setting didn't work sometimes.  
No we fixed it.  

See [issue 1172](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1172) and [PR 1176](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1176).


## News

Wow!

It happened!!!

We published [Selenium IDE plugin](https://github.com/selenide/selenide-for-selenium-ide) which can **export code to Selenide**.
