# Upgraded to selenium 3.11.0 {#updade-to-selenium-3.11.0}

The main [changes in selenium 3.11.0]({{site.SELENIUM_CHANGELOG}}) are about Internet Explorer and Windows platform.

And also:

* removed methods `startClient` and `stopClient` in class `RemoteWebDriver`
* remove properties `SafariOptions.cleanSession` and `SafariOptions.port` 

<br>

# Added collection condition `textsInAnyOrder` {#texts-in-any-order}

Now you can write more advanced check for collections:

```java
$$.shouldHave(textsInAnyOrder("Push", "Image", "Email"))
```

See [issue 478](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/478)  -- thanks to [hyunil-shin](https://github.com/hyunil-shin) for [PR 589](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/589)

<br>

# Now you can set browser position {#browser-position}

As usually, either via system property:

```bash
-Dselenide.browserPosition=300x200
```

or in code:

```java
Configuration.browserPosition = "400x300";
```

See [issue 687](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/687)  -- thanks to [Aliaksandr Rasolka](https://github.com/rosolko) for [PR 687](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/687)

<br>


# Now Selenide can download files with non-ascii characters in name {#download-files-with-cyrillic-letters}

Now this code will work correctly:

```java
  File file = $("a").download();
  assertThat(file.getName()).isEqualTo("файл-с-русским-названием.txt");
```

Before this release, Selenide created a file with name `-------.txt`

See [issue 688](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/688) and [PR 689](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/689)

<br>

# Now you can pass `chromeoptions.prefs` to webdriver {#chrome-prefs}
 
Similar to `chromeoptions.args`, now you can pass parameter `chromeoptions.prefs` to your tests:

```bash
-Dchromeoptions.prefs=profile.block_third_party_cookies=false,profile.avatar_index=26
```

See [PR 692](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/692)  -  thanks to [Tymur Kubai](https://github.com/sirdir)

<br>

# Now you can add your own interceptor to Selenide built-in proxy server {#proxy-filters}

People asked for this feature for a long time. And we finally did it!

```java
getSelenideProxy().addRequestFilter("proxy-usages.request", new RequestFilter() {...});
getSelenideProxy().addResponseFilter("proxy-usages.response", new ResponseFilter() {...});
```

In `RequestFilter` and `ResponseFilter` subclasses you can do pretty anything that is not possible in pure Selenium: 
log requests/responses between browser and server, measure times, get http status, modify request or response body, 
inject custom JavaScript to html etc. This is the _god mode_ in Selenide!   

I hope you are going to use the god mode to make your tests more fast and stable.

As usually, you can find sample usages [in Selenide own tests](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/blob/master/statics/src/test/java/integration/proxy/ProxyServerUsageTest.java).

NB! Now Selenide starts its built-in proxy server only if `Configuration.fileDownload=PROXY`.

Probably we should break this dependency. Feel free to send your feedback.

<br>

# Method `$.followLink()` was marked as deprecated {#deprecate-follow-link}

Nobody remembers why it was created 7 years ago. But now you can just use `$.click()` instead.

<br>


# Fixed a occasional NullPointerException in SelenideReport {#null-pointer-in-selenide-report}

Nobody knows how to reproduce it, but we had to fix it. 

Thanks to [dkorobtsov](https://github.com/dkorobtsov) for [PR 686](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/686)

<br>

# We fixed a problem when Selenide didn't take screenshot in soft asserts {#take-screenshot-for-soft-asserts}

See [issue 655](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/655)  -   thanks to [Boris Osipov](https://github.com/BorisOsipov) for [PR 659](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/659)
