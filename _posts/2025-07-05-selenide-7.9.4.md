Hey there!

I get it â€” it's July, it's hot, work's the last thing on your mind. But you do need to update to [Selenide 7.9.4](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/milestone/226?closed=1)!

* [Updated Selenium from 4.33.0 to 4.34.0](#update-to-selenium-4.34.0)
* [Fixed colors in video recorder in Firefox](#fix-colors-in-video-recorder-in-firefox)
* [Changed type to `SelenideAppiumElement` in mobile methods](#change-return-type-to-selenide-appium-element)
* [Replaced `ContextAware` by `SupportsContextSwitching`](#replace-context-aware)
* [News](#news)

### Updated Selenium from 4.33.0 to 4.34.0 {#update-to-selenium-4.34.0}
And updated CDP from v137 to v138.   
Also, updated Appium from 9.4.0 to 9.5.0

Bloody incredible!

See [PR 3059](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/3059)

### Fixed colors in video recorder in Firefox {#fix-colors-in-video-recorder-in-firefox}

Recently we already [fixed colors in video recorder](/2025/05/08/selenide-7.9.2/#fix-color-on-video), but 
it turned out that they were fixed in all browsers except Firefox. :)

As a result of a small debugging, we found out that Firefox makes screenshots in RGBA format, while other browsers in RGB.
But the WEBM format, in which we create videos, does not support RGBA. :(

So we had to invent a hack: first convert RGBA screenshots to RGB, and only then glue them together into a video. 

See [issue 3042](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/3042) and [PR 3043](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/3043).

### Changed type to `SelenideAppiumElement` in mobile methods {#change-return-type-to-selenide-appium-element}

If you use `selenide-appium` for writing mobile tests, you might have experienced one annoying problem.
Sometimes you could not chain methods.

For example, this code didn't compile:
```java
SelenideAppium.$(AppiumBy.id("id"))
  .shouldBe(visible) // returns SelenideElement
  .tap(); // it's a method of SelenideAppiumElement
```

Now this code compiles because `shouldBe` (in `SelenideAppium` class) now returns `SelenideAppiumElement`.

Thanks to [qwez](https://github.com/qwez) for [PR 3049](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/3049).

### Replaced `ContextAware` `*.selenium.ContextAware` by `*.appium.*.SupportsContextSwitching` {#replace-context-aware}

It's boring, but I have to mention it.  
Interface `org.openqa.selenium.ContextAware` was removed in Selenium 4.34.0, but
it was still used in Appium and Selenide.
So we had to replaced it by Appium's interface `io.appium.java_client.remote.SupportsContextSwitching`.
Now you know :) 

See [PR 3040](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/3040).

### Migrated from OSS to Maven Central {#publish-jars-to-maven-central}

It was a happy day - June 30, 2025. All open-source maintainers got a headache: OSS Sonatype site stopped. We used this 
site for publishing open-source project releases. So we had to learn a new way to publish projects via Maven Central portal.

Starting from Selenide 7.9.4, we also publish new jars via Maven Central portal. Feel free to report issues if you find some issues with it.  

See [4e6e9f10](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/commit/4e6e9f10), [d69efa6a](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/commit/d69efa6a) and [76dfb395](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/commit/76dfb395).
