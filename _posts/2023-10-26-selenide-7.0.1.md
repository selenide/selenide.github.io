Yesterday we released [Selenide 7.0.0](/2023/10/25/selenide-7.0.0/). I expected complains about Java 17, but...

no. Nobody complained about Java 17. And that's great!   
But people asked to restore loops over collections.  

Well, in today update [Selenide 7.0.1](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/milestone/194?closed=1) we restored a couple of things:

* [Restore loops over collections](#restore-collection-loop)
* [Restore method `isEmpty()` for collections](#restore-collection-is-empty)
* [Return field `self` in containers](#restore-self-in-containers)
* [Renamed `CollectionCondition` to `WebElementsCondition`](#rename-collection-condition)

<br>

### Restore loops over collections {#restore-collection-loop}

Now you can use `for` loop again:
```java
for (SelenideElement element : $$(".element")) {
  element.shouldBe(visible);
}
```

And I wonâ€™t tire of repeating that 
> DON'T DO IT!

[Don't use loops and ifs in tests!](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/wiki/do-not-use-getters-in-tests)

If you want to collect the texts/attributes of all elements to check them - Selenide has "collection conditions" for that:
```java
  $$(".errors").shouldHave(texts("One", "Two", "Three"));

  $$("#numbers option").shouldHave(attributes("value",
                   "one", "two", "three", "four", "five"));
```

If you haven't found a suitable check for your needs, you can easily create your own [custom condition](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/wiki/Custom-collection-conditions).
Just create a class inheriting `WebElementsCondition` and implement method `check`. That's easy.   
And you can reuse it in all your tests.

See [PR 2533](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2533).

### Restore method `isEmpty()` for collections {#restore-collection-is-empty}

I still understand why, but people do you this method:
```java
  boolean errorsFound = $$(".error").isEmpty();
```

See [PR 2533](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2533).

<br>

### Return field `self` in containers {#restore-self-in-containers}

In release 7.0.0, we removed class `ElementsContainer`. With this, you lost method `getSelf()`. 
I still find it strange, but people do you this method as well. 

If this sounds like you, then you can replace the `getSelf()` method with a field annotated by `@Self`:

```java
static class RadioButton implements Container {
  @Self
  SelenideElement label;

  @FindBy(tagName = "input[type=radio]")
  SelenideElement input;
}
```

See [PR 2534](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2534).

<br>

### Renamed `CollectionCondition` to `WebElementsCondition` {#rename-collection-condition}

It affects you only if you have [custom collection conditions](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/wiki/Custom-collection-conditions). 

Not a problem. Just replace `extends CollectionCondition` by `WebElementsCondition`. 

See [issue 2372](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/2372) and [PR 2533](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2533).
