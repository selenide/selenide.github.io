Good night!

We have released [Selenide 5.14.0](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/milestone/101?closed=1).  
  

## Stabilized new file downloading mode `FOLDER`

... which was introduced in [Selenide 5.13.0](/2020/07/08/selenide-5.13.0/). 

What has been changed in 5.14.0:
1. Every time when Selenide opens a browser it creates a unique downloads folder for it.  
    It helps to avoid situation when parallel tests are downloading multiple files to the same folder at the same time. 
    And it's impossible to understand what file is downloaded by which test.     
      
    See [issue 1220](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1220) and [PR 1221](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1221).  
    
      * Unfortunately, it doesn't work in IE and Safari (which don't allow to customize downloads folder).  
      * It works only for browsers opened by Selenide itself. 
      * If you create browser by yourself, you will need to create the downloads folder and pass it to Selenide:
        * either using new method `setWebDriver(driver, proxy, downloadsFolder)`.  
        * or constructor `SelenideDriver(..., downloadsFolder)`.  
2. Before downloading next file, Selenide clears the downloads folder  --  see [PR 1252](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1252)
3. In the end of tests run, Selenide deletes all empty downloads folders  --  see [PR 1247](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1247)


## Added check `$$.shouldHave(itemWithText("any text"))`

Unlike the classic check `$$.shouldHave(texts("text1", "text2"))`, it verifies that collection contains **at least one
 element with given text**.     

Thanks to [Luis Serna](https://github.com/LuisOsv) for [PR 1194](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1194).  

By the way, it's the first commit to Selenide from Bolivia! :)


## Added support for Safari browser

Few years ago Selenide already had Safari support, but it seemed to work badly at that time.  
At some moment, we removed the Safari support.    
Now it's the next try. This time Safari tests seem to work more or less.  

As usually, you need to add just one line to run tests in Safari:
1. `Configuration.browser = "safari";` or
2. `-Dselenide.browser=safari`

Please share your feedback.   

See [issue 1236](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1236) and [PR 1237](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1237).


## Added method `SelenideDriver.screenshot(fileName)`

It may be useful when you create "non-static" variant of driver (`new SelenideDriver()`) and want to take screenshots.    
Now you can do it.  

See [issue 1166](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1166) and [PR 1227](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1227).


## Added method `SelenideDriver.screenshot(OutputType)`

Sometimes you need to get screenshot in Base64 format. For example, some visual comparison tools want it.  

Now you can get screenshot as Base64 (or File or bytes) with new method `screenshot(OutputType)`:

```java
String screenshot = Selenide.screenshot(OutputType.BASE64);
byte[] decoded = Base64.getDecoder().decode(screenshot);
BufferedImage img = ImageIO.read(new ByteArrayInputStream(decoded));
```

See [issue 1224](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1224) and [PR 1231](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1231).


## Now Selenide takes a screenshot when method `switchTo()` fails

As you know, Selenide automatically takes a screenshot in case of test failure.   
But we found that Selenide didn't take a screenshot if one of these methods failed:
* `switchTo(frame)`
* `switchTo(window)`
* `switchTo(alert)`
  
Now we fixed it.    

See [issue 1190](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1190) and [PR 1240](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1240).


## Added chrome option `--disable-dev-shm-usage`

We found that without this option, Chrome might sometimes crash (because of out of memory error).  
1. Why nobody complained about this?
2. Are thing better now after adding this option? Please share your feedback.  

## Fixed Sizzle selectors on web pages containing Dojo.js, troop.js etc.

See [issue 434](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/434) and [PR 1242](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1242).


## Made method `$.toString()` safer

See [issue 1241](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1241) and [PR 1245](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1245).


## Improved error message when web element has disappeared

See [issue 1013](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1013) and [PR 1239](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1239).


## Upgraded to WebDriverManager 4.1.0

See [WDM Changelog](https://github.com/bonigarcia/webdrivermanager/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).
