# Hey there!

<br>
We did yet another nano-release [Selenide 6.7.4](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/milestone/164?closed=1).

<br>

### Added setting `remoteReadTimeout` {#add-remote-read-setting}

I recently [complained about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KGtZoFVzr8&list=PL9Z-JgiTsOYRfoG_mcRBlTUIFPIknhQ6S) too many settings in Selenide.

Nevertheless, we added yet another setting `Configuration.remoteReadTimeout` (a.k.a. `-Dselenide.remoteReadTimeout`). 

It may be useful if you run browser on a remote server, but the number if browser is limited on that server, and
your tests need to wait in a queue for a free browser. In this case the default timeout for 1.5 minutes might not be
enough, and you need to increase the timeout.

Now you can set any timeout from build scripts, command line etc. 

Thanks to [Rodion Goritskov](https://github.com/rodion-goritskov) for [PR 1936](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1936).

### Fixed mini-bug in "Dead threads watchdog" {#fix-dead-threads-watchdog}

Have you ever seen `java.lang.IllegalStateException: Shutdown in progress` in logs?

It means you hasn't upgraded to [Selenide 6.7.2](/2022/08/14/selenide-6.7.2/) :) 

Now I recommend to upgrade to 6.7.4 - and you get fixed both memory leaks and IllegalStateException. 

See [issue 1942](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1942) and [PR 1943](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1943).
