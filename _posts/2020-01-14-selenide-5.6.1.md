Happy New Year for everyone!

New year - new release. Please welcome [Selenide 5.6.1](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/milestone/88?closed=1).


# Added method `Selenide.executeAsyncScript()`

I guess all of you have used method `Selenide.executeJavaScript()`. 
JavaScript gives us [a big power](/2019/12/24/advent-calendar-javascript-tricks/) in test automation.

Now we added a method `Selenide.executeAsyncScript()`. It can be used for executing asynchronous functions (like `setTimeout`, `$.get` etc.)

Please note that it's a little bit harder to use than `executeJavaScript()`.  
After calling asynchronous JS methods need to execute `callback` with a return value. You have to get `callback` from a _last argument_:

```java
long value = (Long) Selenide.executeAsyncJavaScript(
      "var callback = arguments[arguments.length - 1]; " + 
      "setTimeout(function() { " + 
      "   // Here is your asynchronous JS code: " +
      "   ... " +
      "   // and return to Selenium: " +
      "   callback(10);" + 
      "}, 5000);"
    );
    assertThat(value).isEqualTo(10);
```

See [issue 1030](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1030).  
Thanks to [Thierry Ygé](https://github.com/tyge68) for [PR 1031](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1031).

# Now Selenide can download files without `Content-Disposition` header (via proxy)

As you know, Selenide can download files via its built-in proxy server.  
But until now, it intercepted only server responses containing `Content-Disposition` header (to get the name of file being downloaded).  

But it appeared that this header is not always required. Sometimes files can be downloaded without this header.

Now Selenide proxy got to be smarter. Starting from Selenide 5.6.1, it works as follows:
1. Before starting download, it waits until all previous requests/responses between browser and server are completed.
2. It clicks the download button.
3. It intercepts ALL requests between browser and server (no matter which headers they contain).
4. And tries to understand which of them is more like a file download. 

If this response doesn't contain `Content-Disposition` header, the name of the file is taken from URL.

See [issue 1034](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1034) and [PR 1035](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1035).

# Fix method `WebDriverRunner.using()`

We [added method `using`](/2019/10/16/selenide-5.4.0/#add-method-using) in October, 2019.  
We recently found a bug in this method: it closed the webdriver (but should not). Now we fixed this bug.

See [commit 4d1b19972d](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/commit/4d1b19972d).

# Upgraded to WebDriverManager 3.8.0 

It contains lot of bugfixes, including those reported by me :) 

See [changelog](https://github.com/bonigarcia/webdrivermanager/compare/webdrivermanager-3.8.0...master).   
Among other improvements, WDM can now work without internet access.
