# Good evening!

<br>
We made another release [Selenide 6.6.6](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/milestone/160?closed=1)

### Removed deprecated capabilities {#remove-deprecated-capabilities}

Some webdriver options (which Selenide has been setting for years) were later marked as deprecated.  
Starting from some release, Selenium started logging warnings about them.

Now Selenide doesn't set them anymore: `acceptSslCerts`, `handlesAlerts`, `javascriptEnabled`, `takesScreenshot`.

We will not forget you, friends! You have served us faithfully for over 10 years.

See [issue 1862](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1862), [issue 1866](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1866)
and [PR 1870](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1870).

### Fixed ClearWithShortcut {#fix-clear-with-shortcut}

... when working with driver wrapped into listeners. It's rare, don't worry. 

Thanks to [Petro Ovcharenko](https://github.com/petroOv-PDFfiller) for [PR 1856](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1856).

<br>

### Added shorter syntax for `$.click` {#shorter-syntax-for-click}

If you wished to click with an offset or custom timeout, you had to write quite a long line:
```java
$.click(withDefaultMethod().offset(123, 222));
$.click(withDefaultMethod().timeout(...));
```

Now you can write a shorter line:
```java
$.click(withOffset(123, 222));
$.click(withTimeout(...));
```

See [PR 1875](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1875).

### Added support for mobile apps {#support-mobile-apps-in-webdriver-health-checker}

... when checking if webdriver is still alive.

This is a minor fix for `selenide-appium`.

When you reuse the same webdriver for multiple tests, Selenide needs to regularly check if the webdriver is still alive.
To check it, Selenide calls `WebDriver.getTitle()`. 

Recently we realised that method `getTitle()` is not supported in Appium. Now we handle this situation properly, and
the browser health check works in Appium too.

See [issue 1878](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1878) and [PR 1879](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1879).

<br>

### Fixed logic of `reopenBrowserOnFail` setting {#fix-reopen-browser-on-fail}

Another improvement for testing mobile apps.

See [issue 1880](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1880) and [PR 1881](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1881).

<br>

### Released selenide-appium 2.1.0 {#release-selenide-appium-2.1.0}

This version contains improved support for running tests for iOS applications.

See [selenide-appium](https://github.com/selenide/selenide-appium/blob/master/CHANGELOG).

<br>

_With this release, we decided to demonstrate to the world community that we do not interfere with the creation of automated tests for mobile applications._

_Now it's up to the automators._
