### Download files from Selenium Grid {#download-files-to-folder-in-selenium-grid}

Finally!   
Now you can download using `FOLDER` method from Selenium Grid.  
Until now, `FOLDER` only worked for local browsers and Selenoid. 

If you run tests in Selenium Grid and need to download files with `FOLDER` method, you just need to replace dependency
```groovy
  com.codeborne:selenide:7.2.0
```

by 
```groovy
  com.codeborne:selenide-grid:7.2.0
```

And that’s basically it.

```java
Configuration.remote = "https://qa.grid.my.com:4444/wd/hub";
Configuration.fileDownload = FOLDER;
File quotes = $("#quotes").download(withExtension("txt"));
assertThat(quotes.content()).contains(
  "Love is stronger than fear",
  "It's a shame to do nothing, it's a shame to allow yourself to be intimidated.");
```

See [issue 1687](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1687), 
[PR 2659](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2659) and [PR 2660](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2660).

### Download files remotely using CDP {#download-files-remotely-with-cdp}

In the previous release, we added method [CDP](/2024/02/07/selenide-7.1.0/#download-files-with-cdp) for downloading files.
But it worked only for local browsers.

Now it also works with remote browsers running on Selenoid or Selenium Grid.

```java
Configuration.remote = "https://cloud.browsers.my.com:4444/wd/hub";
Configuration.fileDownload = CDP;
File places = $("#places").download(withExtension("csv"));
assertThat(places.content()).contains("Church of the Icon of the Mother of God", "Borisovskoye");
```

See [issue 1687](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1687), [issue 2550](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/2550)
and [PR 2661](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2661).

### Collections for mobile tests {#mobile-elements-collections}

We have piled up useful things for testing mobile applications. There are new methods for collections: 

* `SelenideAppium.$$(By)` 
* `SelenideAppium.$$(Collection<WebElement>)`

Both return an instance of `SelenideAppiumCollection`. 
This is basically the same as the old good `ElementsCollection`, but with `SelenideAppiumElement` instances instead of `SelenideElement`.

```java
SelenideAppiumCollection poetry = $$(By.xpath("//android.widget.EditText")).shouldHave(size(2));
poetry.get(0).scroll(up()).setValue("and blood clots will fall into the sky");
poetry.get(1).scroll(down()).setValue("of crimson Kremlin towers");
```

Also, we added method `SelenideAppium.$(WebElement webElement)`, but it's unlikely to be useful to you.

### Disabled chrome warning about stolen password {#disable-chrome-warning-about-stolen-passwords}

After updating Chrome, this annoying dialog “The password... was found in a data breach” started popping up. 
It seems logical that nobody needs this popup in the tests.

Although this looks more like a Chrome 122 bug, we quickly disabled this popup - just in case.

See [issue 2658](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/2658) and [PR 2662](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2662).

### Error message for element without `href` {#improve-error-message-for-download-without-href}

I suddenly realized why so many people struggle with setting up a proxy, and don't even realize that Selenide has easier 
methods for downloading files: `FOLDER` and `CDP`.

Well, the problem might be in communication. All these years, method `$.download()` threw the following error message: 
```java
The element does not have href attribute: <a id="generate-report">
```

Seeing this message, people opened the [first post from Google](https://selenide.org/2019/12/10/advent-calendar-download-files/) - which
is 5 years old and mentioned only one alternative - `PROXY`. And they rushed to study the proxy.

Now the error message will indicate that there are multiple downloading methods:
```java
The element does not have "href" attribute: <a id="generate-report">, so method HTTPGET cannot download the file.
Please try another download method: FOLDER, CDP or PROXY.
Read more about possible download methods: https://selenide.org/javadoc/current/com/codeborne/selenide/FileDownloadMode.html
```

However, I'm afraid this won't help, because who reads them...

See [PR 2653](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2653).

### Updated Selenium from 4.17.0 to 4.18.1 {#upgraded-to-selenium-4.18.1}

See [Selenium changelog](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/trunk/java/CHANGELOG) and 
[PR 2655](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2655).

Let's hope for spring.
