# TERE HOMMIKUST!

<br>
We released [Selenide 6.1.1](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/milestone/141?closed=1).

In this tiny release we fixed a bunch of problems with browser settings.  
These problems arose after upgrading to Selenium 4 where `ChromeOptions` and other `Capabilities` were refactored.  

Now we plunged into the topic and fixed all the problems at once. 


<br>
# Early conflict detection
If you try to open a Chrome with Firefox settings:
```java
Configuration.browser = "chrome";
Configuration.browserCapabilities.setCapability(FIREFOX_OPTIONS, new FirefoxOptions());
```
then Selenide 5.x did show a clear error message, but Selenide 6.0.x didn't.  
Now we have restored the swearing, and you will see the old good 
> IllegalArgumentException: Conflicting browser name: 'chrome' vs. 'firefox'

See [issue 1591](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1591) and [PR 1642](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1642).

# Merging of chrome arguments

Say, if you want to run Chrome in full screen mode or setup its language:
```java
ChromeOptions options = new ChromeOptions();
options.addArguments("--start-fullscreen", "--start-incognito");
options.setExperimentalOption("prefs", ImmutableMap.of("intl.accept_languages", "de_DE"));
Configuration.browserCapabilities = chromeOptions;
open("https://codeborne.com";)
```

then these settings were lost in Selenide 6.0.x  
Now we have restored them.  

See [issue 1626](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1626), 
[issue 1630](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1630) and
[issue 1631](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1631).

The fix was in [PR 1642](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1642).


<br>
# IMPORTANT

If you used `Configuration.browserCapabilities`, then with a high probability you wrapped it into `DesiredCapabilities`:

```java
ChromeOptions options = new ChromeOptions();
options.addArguments(...);

DesiredCapabilities caps = new DesiredCapabilities();
caps.setCapability(ChromeOptions.CAPABILITY, options);
Configuration.browserCapabilities = caps;
```

Now you have to **simplify your code**, to avoid loosing of your settings:
```java
ChromeOptions options = new ChromeOptions();
options.addArguments(...);
Configuration.browserCapabilities = options;
```

<br>
# We changed the parameter type of `WebDriverProvider` 

... from `DesiredCapabilities` to just `Capabilities`. 

For you, almost nothing changes. If you use `WebDriverProvider` in your tests, simply
change `DesiredCapabilities` to` Capabilities` and everything will work as previously. 

See [PR 1642](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1642).

<br>

_More capabilities for the Capabilities God!_

<br>
# UPD Selenide 6.1.2

We released Selenide 6.1.2 with upgrade to Selenium 4.1.1. It has several remarkable bugfixes.
