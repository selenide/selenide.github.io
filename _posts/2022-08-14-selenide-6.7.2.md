# Good Sunday!

<br>
We made a mini-release [Selenide 6.7.2](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/milestone/162?closed=1) fixing a few memory leaks.

But don't worry, they are non-critical. It is unlikely that any of you even noticed them.

### Fixed a memory leak with shutdown hooks in Selenide {#fix-selenide-memory-leak}

If you open and close a browser multiple times in a test
```java
for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
  open("about:blank");
  closeWebDriver();
}
```

then memory consumption starts growing:

     style="width: 100%" alt="Memory consumption: before"/>

It's caused by shutdown hooks that Selenide adds for every opened browser. And never removes them until the end of JVM. 

See [issue 1917](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1917)
and [PR 1919](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1919).

After upgrading to version 6.7.2, memory consumption doesn't grow anymore:

     style="width: 100%" alt="Memory consumption: after"/>

### Fixed a memory leak in LittleProxy {#fix-little-proxy-memory-leak}

We upgraded to LittleProxy 2.0.11 which also contains a memory leak fix.

See [PR 1918](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1918)
and [PR 141](https://github.com/LittleProxy/LittleProxy/pull/141)

<br>

### Upgraded to Selenium 4.4.0 {#upgrade-to-selenium-4.4.0}

which even contains one my personal fix! Which, by the way, helped us fix the next problem.

See [PR 1913](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1913)
and [Selenium changelog](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/trunk/java/CHANGELOG)

<br>

### Fixed `full-size-screenshot` plugin {#fix-full-size-screenshot}

Our new plugin `full-size-screenshot` had one known problem (caused by a known bug in Selenium):
if you run a browser remotely and open multiple tabs or windows, Selenide might take screenshot from a wrong window.

This bug was fixed in Selenium 4.4.0, and now in Selenide too.

See [PR 1920](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1920) and [PR 10811](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/pull/10811).
