### Added method `$.cached()` {#add-method-cached}

Sometimes you need to write quite complex code for finding an element.  
And it might work **slowly**, especially if you find it from a long collection applying specific filtering.  
Something like this:

```java
ElementsCollection subscriptions = $$("div.subs-expands")
  .filter(childExactText(
     By.xpath(".//div[contains(@class,'data')]//div[contains(@class,'heading')]"),
     orderNumber)
  );

SelenideElement target = subscriptions
  .filter(childAttributeValue(...))
  .find(childExactText(....));
```

Every call to `target` is apparently slow. 

Now you can speed up such tests by caching the `target` element:
```java
SelenideElement target = subscriptions
  .filter(..)
  .find(..)
  .cached();
```

Obviously, you can cache it only if you are sure that it's not updated/reloaded during the test.   
If it still gets reloaded, you will get the famous `StaleElementReferenceException`. 

See [issue 2171](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/2171),
[issue 1927](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1927) 
and [PR 2189](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2189).

### Added http status to server response mock {#mock-response-with-http-status}
Selenide has method for mocking a server response:

```java
getSelenideProxy().responseMocker().mockText("login-mock", 
          urlContains(POST, "/login"), () -> "{role: admin}");
```

It allowed to mock only response body, response status was always 200 ("OK").  
Now you can set another status too:
```java
getSelenideProxy().responseMocker().mockText("login-mock", 
          urlContains(POST, "/login"), 403, () -> "{role: looser}");
```

See [issue 2227](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/2227) and [PR 2234](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2234).

<br>

### Added method `inNewBrowser` for running a code snippet in a new browser {#add-method-in-new-browser}

Sometimes you want to run a code block in a new browser.
> Usually I say it's a bad practice. Actions like data preparation etc. should not be performed via UI
> (we are testing UI -> we cannot trust UI). Instead, you should use some reliable way: using API, query to database etc. 

Still, for this purpose we have [method  `using`](/2019/10/16/selenide-5.4.0/#add-method-using). But to use it, you 
need to open your custom webdriver with some specific settings. But what if you don't specific settings? What if you
need a standard webdriver with usual Selenide settings - just a new instance of browser?

Now you can use method `inNewBrowser` for that:
```java
open("https://site.com/login/as/user/bob");

inNewBrowser(() -> {
  open("https://site.com/login/as/admin");
  $(by("value", "bob")).find("[name=is_admin]").setEnabled();
});

$("h1").shouldHave(text("Hello, chat admin!"));
```

See [issue 2213](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/2213) and [PR 2236](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2236).

<br>

### Added method `$.doubleClick(options)` {#add-method-doubleclick-with-options}

We already had method `$.doubleClick()` which could only click the center of given element. 
Now it got an advanced bro with `options` parameter. The options are the same as for usual `$.click` method:

```java
$(".btn").doubleClick(usingDefaultMethod());
$(".btn").doubleClick(usingJavaScript());
$(".btn").doubleClick(usingDefaultMethod().offset(66, 33));
$(".btn").doubleClick(usingJavaScript().offset(66, 33).withTimeout(ofSeconds(9)));
```

See [issue 2133](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/2133).

### Added condition `$.shouldHave(innerText())` {#add-condition-inner-text}

It allows to check texts of hidden elements. 
> Probably it's a bad idea: if real users cannot see the element then you don't need to test it. 

But if you really want, you can now use condition `innerText`:
```java
$("#theHiddenElement")
  .shouldHave(innerText("Can you see the hidden text?"));
  // Usual $("#theHiddenElement").text() returns an empty string here: "";
```
See [issue 2220](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/2220) and [PR 2223](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2223).

<br>

### Added collection condition `$$.shouldHave(attributes(...))` {#add-condition-attributes}

```java
$$("#numbers option").shouldHave(attributes("value",
                "one", "two", "three", "four", "five"));
```

See [issue 2091](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/2091).
Thanks to [Alexey Lakovych](https://github.com/AlexLAA) for [PR 2091](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2091).
See also [PR 2230](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2230).

### Added a clear error message in methods `$.select*()` {#clear-error-message-in-select}

Selenide has convenient methods for working with dropdowns:
```java
$("select#gender").selectOptionContainingText("Female");
```

Recently we [changed their implementation to JavaScript](/2022/11/21/selenide-6.10.0/#select-options-using-javascript) - it's faster and stable. 

But it turned out that if you mistakenly call such a method for a non-`<select>`, a very incomprehensible error took off:
```java
$("ul").selectOptionContainingText("Kelly Snyder");
--> JavascriptException: 
      javascript error: 
        undefined is not iterable (cannot read property Symbol(Symbol.iterator))
```

Now this error message will be clear:
```java
IllegalArgumentException: Cannot select option from a non-select element
```

See [issue 2231](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/2231) and [PR 2233](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2233).

### Fixed bug in method `$$.subList()` {#fix-method-sublist}

As you know, Selenide has methods for checking the whole collection of elements with one line:

```java
  $$("#numbers").shouldHave(texts("One", "Two", "Three", "Four", "Five"));
```

Method `$$` returns an object `ElementsCollection`, which (unfortunately) is inherited from `AbstractList<SelenideElement>`.
Thus, it inherits few unexpected methods that we initially didn't think about. 

One of such methods is `subList`:

```java
  $$(".user").subList(1, 4).iterator();
```

This iterator returns two, not three elements. It truncates the last element. Oops... `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

Now this bug is fixed. Iterator will return all elements. 

See [issue 2239](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/2239) and [PR 2240](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2240).
