### Upgraded to Selenium 4.11.0 {#update-to-selenium-4.11.0}
We upgraded Selenium version from 4.10.0 to 4.11.0.

Read the full Selenium changelog [here](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/trunk/java/CHANGELOG).

See [PR 2393](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2393).

### Replaced WebDriverManager by SeleniumManager {#replace-webdrivermanager-by-selenium-manager}

Starting from version 4.6.0, Selenium has built-in tool for downloading webdriver binaries - SeleniumManager. 
Afaik, it's developed by the same [Boni Garcia](https://bonigarcia.dev/), who created WebDriverManager. 
But now it's an official part of Selenium project. 

Read more about SeleniumManager [here](https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2023/whats-new-in-selenium-manager-with-selenium-4.11.0/).

**And now Selenide uses SeleniumManager instead of WebDriverManager.**

* Yes, we had to remove setting `Configuration.driverManagerEnabled` and method `DriverFactory.setupWebdriverBinary`.
It might cause compilation errors in your projects.
* Yes, it's slightly bad that we did it _unexpectedly_. Usually we don't remove the API immediately, but first mark it as 
`@Deprecated`, and remove only in next major release.

But we had no choice. 

Starting from version 5.4.0, WDM started requiring Java11+ and stopped working with Chrome 115.
While SeleniumManager still works on Java 8 and supports Chrome 115. And works out of the box. _What else was left for us?_

See [issue 2402](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/2402) and [PR 2400](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2400).

<br>

P.S. If you still want to use WebDriverManager - not a problem. Just add it explicitly as a dependency to your project
and call in the beginning of your tests:
```java
  WebDriverManager.chromedriver().setup();
  WebDriverManager.firefoxdriver().setup();
  WebDriverManager.edgedriver().setup();
  etc.
```
<br>

### Restored support for Java 8 {#support-java8-again}

In the last release, Selenide occasionally started requiring Java 11. It happened because of WebDriverManager update 
mentioned before. 

Now it's gone: no WebDriverManager - no problems. :)

Oldschoolers, you can run your tests on Java 8 again.

> Nevertheless, I recommend you to upgrade to Java 11  
> (or even better to Java 17).  
> In the following autumn, Selenium will upgrade to Java 11 anyway, and then you will definitely have no choice.  

See [issue 2385](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/2385) and [PR 2400](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2400).

### Added method `$.type()` for slow typing {#add-method-type}

This feature has been requested for a very long time. And finally!

Method `$.type()` does almost the same as `$.sendKeys()`, but slowly. With delays between key presses. It emulates like 
a real user is typing a text. May be useful for testing autocompletion, automated suggestions, hints, validation etc.

```java
import static com.codeborne.selenide.TypeOptions.*;

$("#query").type("Who the fuck is yevgeny prigozhin");
$("#query").type(text("Who the fuck is dmitry utkin"));
$("#query").type(text("Who the fuck is lvova-belova").withDelay(ofMillis(100)));
```

By default, the delay between key presses is 200 milliseconds.

<br>


### For mobile apps: click with long press {#click-with-long-press}

Now you can use this gesture when testing mobile apps:

```java
import static com.codeborne.selenide.appium.SelenideAppium.$;
import static com.codeborne.selenide.appium.AppiumClickOptions.*;

$.click(longPress()); // by default 3 seconds
$.click(longPressFor(Duration.ofSeconds(4)));
```

See [issue 2370](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/2370).
Thanks to [Amuthan Sakthivel](https://github.com/amuthansakthivel) for [PR 2381](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2381).

<br>

### For mobile apps: swipe left and right {#swipe-right-and-left}

Now you can use this gesture when testing mobile apps:

```java
import static com.codeborne.selenide.appium.SelenideAppium.$;
import static com.codeborne.selenide.appium.AppiumSwipeOptions.*;

$.swipeTo(); // by default swipes to the right
$.swipe(right());
$.swipe(right(20));
$.swipe(left());
$.swipe(left(30));
```

Thanks to [Amuthan Sakthivel](https://github.com/amuthansakthivel) for [PR 2369](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2369).

<br>

So, update, try and share:
> How do you like SeleniumManager?  
> Everything is broken, or we can live with it?
