# Gootas morningas!

<br>
We made another mini-released [Selenide 6.6.4](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/milestone/158?closed=1).


### Added condition `exactTextsCaseSensitive` for collections {#exact-texts-case-sensitive}

Selenide has several built-in checks for collections texts:
```java
$$("li").shouldHave(texts("foo", "bar", "baz"));
$$("li").shouldHave(textsInAnyOrder("foo", "bar", "baz"));
$$("li").shouldHave(exactTexts("foo", "bar", "baz"));
// etc.
```

Now there is one more check available:
```java
$$("li").shouldHave(exactTextsCaseSensitive("foo", "bar", "baz"));
```

Thanks to [Ben Heap](https://github.com/ben-nc2) for [PR 1861](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1861).

### Made method `$.getSelectedOption()` lazy {#selected-option-lazy-loaded}

By design, (almost) all Selenide methods [should be lazy](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/wiki/Lazy-loading).

For example, call to `$("#nope")` does NOT fail even if the element doesn't exist. It allows writing negative checks, e.g.
```java
$("#nope").shouldNot(exist);
```

We realized we method `$("select").getSelectedOption()` was not lazy. It failed immediately if the select was not 
loaded yet etc.  
So you could not write such a negative check:
```java
  var option = $("select#gender").getSelectedOption();  // failed on this line
  option.shouldNot(exist);
```

Now we have corrected this issue. _The laziness won!_
See [issue 1581](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1581) and [PR 1864](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1864).
