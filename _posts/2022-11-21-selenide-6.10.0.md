### Improved file download algorithm {#slow-download-in-firefox}

Selenide contains several algorithms for downloading files: `HTTPGET`, `PROXY` and `FOLDER`.
Let's talk about `FOLDER`.
To download a file, it clicks the button and waits for new files in downloads folder. 
```java
File racoons = $("#stolenRaccoonsReport").download(using(FOLDER));
assertThat(racoons).hasName("racoons.xls");
```

The problem is that it didn't work well in Firefox in case of very slow download. 
We realized that Firefox creates immediately two files: "racoons.xls" and "racoons.xls.part" - both are empty. 
And only then starts filling "racoons.xls.part". 

<br>
Now the `FOLDER` algorithm is smarter. It
1. waits until some suitable file appears in the downloads folder;
2. waits until all `*part` files disappear (in Firefox); 
3. waits until all `*crdownload` (in Chrome); 
4. waits until none of files has been modified for 1+ seconds (in other browsers).

This approach should provide more reliable file downloads. 

See [issue 1989](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1989) and [PR 2003](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2003).

### Fail fast the downloading process if no progress observed {#fail-download-early}

People often set a long timeout for downloading files. Especially when downloading a large file:
```java
File video = $("#skaebova").download(using(FOLDER)
  .withTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(99))
  .withName("puten mobshiza.MP4"));
```

But it doesn't make sense so long if the downloading process has not even started. 
For example, if the click missed the button (how it can happen, I showed in video ["Flaky tests"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c5XT2v5gRY&ab_channel=DEVCLUB.EE&t=37m31s)).  

To fail earlier, you can set another parameter "increment timeout":
```java
File video = $("#skaebova").download(using(FOLDER)
  .withTimeout(ofSeconds(99))
  .withIncrementTimeout(ofSeconds(2))
  .withName("puten mobshiza.MP4"));
```

In this case, the general download timeout is 99 seconds, BUT it during 2 seconds none of files is modified, then the 
method will throw an exception immediately.  

See [issue 1990](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1990) and [PR 2023](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2023).

### Select `<select>` options using JavaScript {#select-options-using-javascript} 

It should made work with `<select>`s faster. As a bonus, now Selenide throws a more detailed exception if `<select>` (or `<option>`) was `disabled`.

Given a `<select>` with some disabled options:
```html
<select id="region">
  <option value="belgorod">Belgorod</option>
  <option value="kherson" disabled>Kherson</option>
  <option value="zaporozhia" disabled>Zaporozhia</option>
</select>
```

Trying to select a `disabled` option:
```java
$("#region").selectOption("Kherson");
```

will throw a clear error message:
```java
Invalid element state [#region/option[text:Kherson]]: Cannot select a disabled option
```

Before this release, the error was not so detailed:
```java
java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: You may not select a disabled option
```

(and even earlier, such a test did not fall at all, but did not select the option either)

See [issue 1553](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1553) and [PR 1876](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1876).

> Specials thanks to [Oleg Berezhnoy](https://github.com/bereg2k) for [PR 1553](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1553). 
> Though it was not merged, it triggered a discussion in Selenide and even in Selenium team: what is a "just framework" 
> and "opinionated framework".  

<br>

### Made `$.click(options)` chainable {#make-click-chainable}

People often complain that method `$.click()` has return type `void`. You cannot chain it like this:
```java
  $(".btn").click().should(disappear);
```

Alas, we cannot fix it, since class `SelenideElement` inherits method `void click()` from Selenium's `WebElement`.

But we made chainable another (overloaded) `click` method (the one with parameters).  
At least this one can now be chained:
```java
  $(".btn")
    .click(usingDefaultMethod())
    .should(disappear);

  $(".btn")
    .click(usingDefaultMethod().withOffset(42, 42))
    .shouldHave(cssClass("alert"));
```

See [issue 2007](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/2007) and [PR 2008](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2008).

### Fixed window size of new tabs {#fix-size-for-new-tabs}

Thanks to [Boris Osipov](https://github.com/BorisOsipov) for [PR 2017](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2017).

P.S. Fixed once again in [Selenide 6.10.1](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/milestone/170?closed=1)

<br>

### Support BasicAuth login/password with special characters {#encode-basic-auth-credentials-in-url}

Selenide can open sites protected by BasicAuth:
```java
open("/basic-auth/hello", BASIC, 
  new BasicAuthCredentials("", "Královec", "is Czechia /:)"));
```

This login/password is added either to http header `Authorization` (if proxy is enabled) or URL (if proxy is disabled).

Recently I discovered that the the second way doesn't work correctly if login or password contains special characters. 
When adding to URL, these characters were not escaped, causing an invalid URL:
```
https://Královec:is Czechia /:)@127.0.0.1:4405/basic-auth/hello
```
browser could not open such a link.

> I am curious, why nobody every complained about that? Do you all use just `scott`/`tiger` credentials? :)

Now Selenide encodes such characters and generates a valid URL:
```
https://Kr%C3%A1lovec:is+Czechia+%2F%3A%29@127.0.0.1:27663/basic-auth/hello
```
See [issue 2020](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/2020) and [PR 2021](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2021).
