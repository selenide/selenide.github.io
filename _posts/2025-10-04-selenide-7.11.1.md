Good morning!

Great news: 
we released [Selenide 7.11.1](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/milestone/230?closed=1).

> Youâ€™re five weeks working on a release that should have taken a week, 
> Are you a paper tiger?

Yes, the changes are more internal to technical. But they still can break something in your tests. ;)

* [Disable smooth scrolling](#disable-smooth-scrolling-by-default)
* [Fixed usage of `Augmenter`](#fix-augmenter-usages)
* [Refactored`ScreenShotLaboratory`](#custom-screenshot-laboratory)
* [Removed hack for `HostIdentifier`](#remove-workaround-for-host-identifier)
* [Publish jars without signing](#publish-jars-without-signing)
* [Updated Selenium from 4.35.0 to 4.36.0](#update-to-selenium-4.36.0)
* [Updated JUnit from 5.x to 6.0.0](#update-to-junit-6.0.0)

### Disable smooth scrolling {#disable-smooth-scrolling-by-default}

Sometimes tests may [flake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18J2_4a4Cl4) when they try to click a web element which is moving exactly at this moment.
Sometimes it's moving because of "smooth scrolling" used in web design. 

Now Selenide adds a special option:
* for Chrome - `--disable-smooth-scrolling`, 
* for Firefox - `general.smoothScroll=false`.

This option disables smooth scrolling, even if it's enabled in CSS. Now the click should work stably.

For other browsers, we couldn't find the needed option. But you can always explicitly call Selenide's [method for scrolling](/2025/08/20/selenide-7.10.0/#scroll-with-options):
```java
$.scrollIntoView(instant());
```

See [issue 2850](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/2850) and [PR 3119](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/3119).

### Fixed usage of `Augmenter` {#fix-augmenter-usages}

Sometimes Selenide could throw such an error:
> ConnectionFailedException: JdkWebSocket initial request execution error

It was flying from method `WebdriverUnwrapper.unwrap` which in turn called Selenium's class `Augmenter`. 
It happens when you run the browser Grid or another cloud, and CDP port is not available from the test machine.  

The real fix should be in [Selenium](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/pull/16338) when it gets finally merged.
But meanwhile, we fixed all usages of `Augmenter` Selenide, so that it's now called in the right moment. 

NB! If you create `new RemoteWebDriver` somewhere in your tests, it's better to immediately wrap it to `Augmenter.augment`:
```java
RemoteWebDriver webDriver = new RemoteWebDriver(gridUrl, options);
webDriver.setFileDetector(new LocalFileDetector());
return new Augmenter().augment(webDriver); // Add this line if you don't have it yet
```
Without it, your `RemoteWebDriver` will not implement interfaces `HasBiDi`, `HasDevTools`, `HasLogEvents` etc. - and the corresponding methods will not work for you.

See [issue 3107](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/3107) and [PR 3114](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/3114).


UPD Next day, we released a fix [7.11.1](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/milestone/231?closed=1), which includes the abovementioned 
[fix for Selenium](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/pull/16338). 


<br>

### Refactored`ScreenShotLaboratory` {#custom-screenshot-laboratory}

We slightly refactored class `ScreenShotLaboratory` - now it's easy to override it, and pass your instance to `SelenideDriver`. 

Thanks to [Matthias Kurz](https://github.com/mkurz) for 
  [PR 3128](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/3128),
  [PR 3130](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/3130),
  [PR 3131](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/3131),
  [PR 3134](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/3134) and
  [PR 3135](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/3135).

### Removed hack for `HostIdentifier` {#remove-workaround-for-host-identifier}

Back in 2021, I added [a hack](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/commit/2eff0307e3a8283b16e1890e2) to Selenide to overcome
a problem with `HostIdentifier` (see [issue 9784](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/issues/9784)).

But this hack had side effects. Sometimes you might see in logs some garbage like this:

```java
WARNING: Failed to resolve host address
java.net.UnknownHostException: gitrun1: gitrun1: Name or service not known
 at java.base/java.net.InetAddress.getLocalHost(InetAddress.java:1936)
 at org.openqa.selenium.net.HostIdentifier.resolveHostAddress(HostIdentifier.java:107)
 at org.openqa.selenium.net.HostIdentifier.getHostAddress(HostIdentifier.java:126)
 at com.codeborne.selenide.drivercommands.CreateDriverCommand.lambda$createDriver$0(CreateDriverCommand.java:46)
 ...
 at com.codeborne.selenide.Selenide.open(Selenide.java:50)
```

Later the problem with `HostIdentifier` was fixed in Selenium, so the hack was not needed anymore. So we finally have removed it from Selenide.

See [PR 3113](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/3113).

<br>

### Publish jars without signing {#publish-jars-without-signing}

If you want to change Selenide code and build locally, you can run this short command:
```bash
  ./gradlew
  
  # or without tests for speed:
  ./gradlew publishToMavenLocal -x test
```

This command builds Selenide binaries and publishes to local maven repository.

We realized that this command didn't work if you haven't configured signing keys. These keys are not needed for most people 
(unless you are going to publish binaries to Central maven repository). 

Now this command works without any keys. Enough for building locally. 
But don't forget to [submit a pull request](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pulls) - maybe your change would be useful for others too?

See [issue 3127](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/3127) and [PR 3132](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/3132).

<br>


### Updated Selenium from 4.35.0 to 4.36.0 {#update-to-selenium-4.36.0}
And bumped CDP from v139 to v140.

See [PR 3133](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/3133)

<br>

### Updated JUnit from 5.x to 6.0.0 {#update-to-junit-6.0.0}

It should be a good release. It requires Java 17 and supports JSpecify annotations. 

> Yes, the JUnit5 library will now be in its sixth version. :)

See [PR 3125](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/3125)

<br>

In the end, the release doesn't bring any major new features, but there's power under the hood! 
Important technical changes that are essential.
Maybe still a real bear, at least here? :)
