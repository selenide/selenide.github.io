# Happy New Year, dear friends!

Santa Claus brought us a new release [Selenide 6.11.0](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/milestone/169?closed=1).

* [Copy-paste methods](#added-copy-paste-methods)
* [Download file behind BasicAuth](#fix-download-with-credentials)
* [Download large files via proxy](#download-large-files-via-proxy)
* [Unexpected alerts](#can-handle-unexpected-alerts)
* [Screenshot file permissions](#fix-screenshot-file-permission)
* [Annotation @As for fields without @FindBy](#support-as-annotation)
* [Last page source](#last-page-source)
* [Page URL in error message](#page-url-in-error-message)

### Added methods to copy and paste text {#added-copy-paste-methods}

We added two methods: 
* `Selenide.copy()` for copying currently selected text to clipboard, and
* `$.paste()` to paste clipboard content into input field.

```java
open("https://best-propaganda-quotes.ru");
$("#solovjov").doubleClick(); // select the quote text
Selenide.copy();
$("[name=q]").paste();
$("[name=q]").shouldHave(text("Life is highly overrated"));
```

Known restrictions: these methods need a graphics environment. So they would not work on server linux.
But simple running `xvfb` should help. 

See [issue 1817](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1817).  
Thanks to [Evgenii Plugatar](https://github.com/evpl) for [PR 2027](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2027).

### Fixed method `Selenide.download(url)` {#fix-download-with-credentials}

...in case if url contains login/password (the resource is protected by BasicAuth). 

For example, this code worked few weeks ago, but stopped working after upgrading Apache Http client (internally used by Selenide):

```java
File f = Selenide.download("https://admin:tiger@the-internet.herokuapp.com/basic_auth");
```

In the latest update, Apache Http client enforced URL validation, and this part with login/password is not allowed anymore
(it's kinda unsafe deprecated way of passing credentials).

Now Selenide removes credentials from url and sends them with http header `Authorization`. 

See [issue 2037](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/2037)
and [PR 2102](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2102).

<br>

### Now Selenide allows downloading large files via proxy {#download-large-files-via-proxy}

If you use `PROXY` method for downloading files, you might know that file size could not exceed 64 megabytes.  
Initially, it seemed a reasonable limit: why should anyone need to load a test bench by downloading giant files?
(even 64 mb was quite big: BrowserUpProxy by default sets limit to 2 megabytes; we increased it to 64 in Selenide)

But it turned out that sometimes people want to test downloading large files.
After a discussion, we decided to simply remove this limit. You decide if you want to load your test environment.

```java
File favoriteMovie = $("#topMovie").download();
assertThat(favoriteMovie)
  .hasName("BadSanta.avi")
  .as("2 GB").hasSize(2147483648L);
```

P.S. Be aware that proxy might not quickly download files that are too large. 
And BrowserUpProxy still has built-in technical restriction of 2 gigabytes (because of Integer type used for file size limit).

But at least now you can download, say, 200 megabyte files.

See [issue 2082](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/2082)
and [PR 2098](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2098).

<br>

### Now you can handle unexpected alerts {#can-handle-unexpected-alerts}

By default, Selenide ignores unexpected alerts in browser.
(More specifically, Selenide runs webdriver with option `capabilities.setCapability(UNHANDLED_PROMPT_BEHAVIOUR, ACCEPT)`).

On the one hand, this is convenient so that tests do not break due to sudden pop-up ads and other useless messages.
On the other hand, sometimes these alerts can contain useful information - in particular, a valuable error message.

If this is your case, now you can override this option:
```java
import static org.openqa.selenium.remote.CapabilityType.UNHANDLED_PROMPT_BEHAVIOUR;
import static org.openqa.selenium.UnexpectedAlertBehaviour.ACCEPT_AND_NOTIFY;

Configuration.browserCapabilities.setCapability(UNHANDLED_PROMPT_BEHAVIOUR, ACCEPT_AND_NOTIFY);
```

Then you will get an exception saying what message that alert contained:
```java
UnhandledAlertException: unexpected alert open: {Alert text : Oops} // chrome
UnhandledAlertException: Accepted user prompt dialog: Oops: // firefox
UnhandledAlertException: unexpected alert open: {Alert text : Oops}  // edge
UnhandledAlertException: : Oops // safari
```

See [issue 2054](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/2054)
and [PR 2095](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2095).

### Fixed permissions for screenshot file  {#fix-screenshot-file-permission}

When your test fails, Selenide automatically takes a snapshot of current page, thus creating two files: : `*.png` and `*.html`. 
It turned out that these files had different permissions:

```
-rw------- 1 root root 300295 Dec 19 10:24 1671441847908.0.png
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 185070 Dec 19 10:24 1671441847908.0.html
```

And it caused difficulties for some advanced devops how wanted to run different step of build pipeline by different users.
_Whatever devops amuses... :)_

Now both files have the same permissions: `-rw-r--r--`. 

See [issue 2081](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/2081)
and [PR 2084](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2084).

<br>

### Support `@As` annotation for fields without `@FindBy` {#support-as-annotation}

In Selenide, you can give readable names (aka "aliases") for page object fields with method `as`:

```java
class LoginPage {
  SelenideElement loginButton = $(By.xpath("/long/ugly/xpath[3]")).as("Login button");
}
```

But there was an idea that it would be convenient to put the name at the beginning of the line.
Otherwise, it would be visually lost on the right of the long selector.

Now you can give alias with annotation `@As`:

```java
class LoginPage {
  @As("Login button")
  SelenideElement loginButton = $(By.xpath("/long/ugly/xpath[3]"));
}
```

But of course, the annotation will work only if you initialize the page object with method `Selenide.page()` or `Selenide.open()`.

See [issue 2087](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/2087)
and [PR 2088](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2088).

<br>

### Added methods to get last saved page source {#last-page-source}

It's rarely needed, so don't bother. Essentially, we added few methods to class `ScreenShotLaboratory`:
`threadScreenshots()`, `contextScreenshots()`, `lastThreadScreenshot()`, `lastContextScreenshot()`.

Thanks to [Arman Ayvazyan](https://github.com/armanayvazyan) for [PR 2065](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2065).

<br>

### Now you can add page URL to error message {#page-url-in-error-message}

Sometimes it might be useful, sometimes harmful.
After a discussion, we decided to make this feature optional (in a form of a plugin).  

Let it stay in experimental status for now.
We will probably play with error message formats in the future. 

See [issue 980](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/980) and [PR 2097](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2097).

### Year summary {#year-summary}

Let's sum up year 2022? During this year, Selenide was mentioned in several ratings:

* [5 Testing Automation Tools](https://qameta.io/blog/5-testing-automation-tools/) in Qameta Software blog
* [Top Java Libraries for Automation Testing in 2022](https://hackernoon.com/top-java-libraries-for-automation-testing-in-2022)
* [Top Java Frameworks to Use in 2022](https://aglowiditsolutions.com/blog/top-java-frameworks/)

and finally,
* Selenide got mentioned on [Selenium official site](https://www.selenium.dev/ecosystem/) in category "Ecosystem".

Selenide monthly downloads statistics **grew by half**:
> from 302 thousands in January  
> to 469 thousands in November. 

### And still {#new-year-wishes}
It's been a terrible year.

I hope that in the coming year the war will end, the guilty will be punished, the citizens of the oppressed countries will finally overthrow their tyrants.

And the beautiful free country of Ukraine will be rebuilt and will bloom more than ever.

> And after a year, we will see you in Kyiv at the wonderful [SeleniumCamp conference](https://seleniumcamp.com/).

Glory to the heroes!
