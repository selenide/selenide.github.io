Good evening!

There is nothing in the World more boring than October. Let's brighten it up with bright news!

Today we released Selenide 5.4.0 with a couple of noticeable changes _which many of you have been asking for a while_.

**UPD** There was a bug in 5.4.0, so please upgrade to **5.4.1**

**UPD 2** There is also a minor bug in 5.4.1: `Configuration.holdBrowserOpen` doesn't work. Will fix it in next version. I hope you don't use it often.


<br/> 

# 1. Fixed "IllegalStateException WebDriver has been closed"

Starting from Selenide 5.0.0 (~1 year ago), many users started complaining about <br/> 
`IIlegalStateException WebDriver has been closed...`. 

Actually it's not a bug, it was intended behaviour. 
I didn't want to fix it for a while because I believe such an exception cannot happen in well-designed tests.
Selenide threw in intentionally to stimulate people design their tests better. 

But we had too many complaints, so I decided to remove this exception - _with a heavy heart_!

> In the end, everyone has the right to fill their own bumps.  

### How this error happened?

Shortly speaking, this exception happens when instance of `SelenideElement` is reused with multiple instances of `SelenideDriver`.
It can happen when `SelenideElement` is declared as a static field (either of a page object or a test).
And is initialized before the browser is opened. Or browser is restarted between tests. 
It also may happen when people use Cucumber which tries to initialize step objects, page objects before opening a browser.
Some folks also put Guice or Spring to their test.  

All of this is over-engineering. It's just not needed.

People, you don't need all these things in tests. Tests must be simple. KISS, _amen_!
 
Watch this presentation to know why [Static fields are evil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFQSOlOOoXE&t=1s).

### What's changed?

But well, people can have different opinions. 
_As a sign of tolerance_, let's meet Selenide 5.4.0

Now this code will work without exceptions:

```java
public class SomeClass {
  private static SelenideElement body = $("body");

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    open("https://mail.ru");
    body.should(exist);

    Selenide.close();

    open("https://mail.ru");
    body.should(exist);   // it threw "IllegalStateException WebDriver has been closed" before Selenide 5.4.0
  }
}
```

# 2. Now method SelenideDriver.close() always closes the browser

Starting from Selenide 5.0.0, people started complaining that method `close()` doesn't close  the browser.
It happened in (rare) cases when browser was opened by user code, not Selenide. 

```java
SelenideDriver browser=new SelenideDriver(new FirefoxDriver());
browser.close(); // it didn't close the browser
browser.getWebDriver().close(); // it did close the browser
```

Actually it's not a bug, it was intended behaviour.
Selenide initially has this principle: it closed only the browser opened by Selenide itself. 
And never closed the browser opened by user: it might be used somewhere else.

But again, we had a lot of complaints. It caused a hassle: you see method `close()`, you call it, it works without exceptions - but the browser is still open. 

Now we fixed it. Method `close()` always closes the browser. 

P.S. If your browser is now being unexpectedly closed - feel free to fire a github issue, we will investigate it. 

See [issue 896](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/896) and [PR 989](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/989)

# 3. We restored short human-readable error messages

You might notice that Selenide 5.3.1 introduced one minor issue. 
Error messages became longer and hard to read:

```java
com.codeborne.selenide.ex.ElementNotFound: Element not found {#customerDashboardButton}
``` 

Now we returned the old good human-readable messages:

```java
Element not found {#customerDashboardButton}
```

P.S. Poor users of `maven-surefire-plugin 2.22.2` will still have long messages, [see details here](/2019/09/07/selenide-5.3.1/). 

See [PR 993](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/993)

# 4. Added method `using` for easier switching between multiple webdrivers

As I already [said before](/2018/10/10/selenide-5.0.0/), using of multiple webdrivers in one test is a bad practice in absolutely most cases.

But again, everyone has the right to fill their own bumps.
Now it's a little more easier to fill that bumps with multiple webdrivers. 

Before Selenide 5.4.0, you had to call `setWebDriver()` all the time - and keep in mind which browser is active at the moment:

```java
var browser1 = new FirefoxDriver();
var browser2 = new FirefoxDriver();

setWebDriver(browser1);
open("http://google.com");
$("h1").shouldHave(text("Released Selenide 5.4.0"));

setWebDriver(browser2);
open("http://yandex.ru");
$("h1").shouldHave(text("Released Selenide 5.4.0"));
``` 

now you can wrap code blocks for different browsers in separate `using` calls:

```java
var browser1 = new FirefoxDriver();
var browser2 = new FirefoxDriver();

using(browser1, () -> {
  open("http://google.com");
  $("h1").shouldHave(text("Released Selenide 5.4.0"));
});

using(browser2, () -> {
  open("http://yandex.ru");
  $("h1").shouldHave(text("Released Selenide 5.4.0"));
});
``` 

See [PR 976](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/976) and code samples in [CustomWebdriverTest.java](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/blob/master/statics/src/test/java/integration/CustomWebdriverTest.java).

# 5. Added protection against one typical error with xpath 

Here is the typical error:

```java
$(".parent").find(By.xpath("/child")).shouldBe(visible);
```

The problem is that XPath starting with a slash ("/") looks for element **from the root of the document** (not from `.parent` element).

We added a protection. Now this code will throw an exception which clearly states the problem and saves your time:
 
```java
IllegalArgumentException: XPath starting from / searches from root
```

The code above can be fixed in different ways (depending on what you actually need):

```java
$(".parent").find(By.xpath("./child")).shouldBe(visible);
$(".parent").find(By.xpath(".//child")).shouldBe(visible);
$(".parent").find(By.xpath("child")).shouldBe(visible);
```

See [PR 963](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/963) and [PR 975](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/975).

# 6. Upgraded dependencies

* upgrade to webdrivermanager:3.7.1
* exclude old Guava dependency coming from net.lightbody.bmp:browsermob-core:2.1.5

Just in case, we discovered a bug in WDM: when you want to download chromedriver 77, it may download "75.0.3770.90" instead.
It's because this version contains substring "77". [Isn't it funny?](https://github.com/bonigarcia/webdrivermanager/issues/391) :)
