Hello!

On this tragic and festive day, we released
[Selenide 6.12.0](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/milestone/173?closed=1).

It doesn't contain any new features, but it introduces new headless mode that might affect your tests. 

* [New headless mode](#new-headless-mode)
* [Improve logging when downloading files](#improve-logs-when-downloading-file)
* [Improved downloading files in Edge on Windows](#improve-download-in-edge)
* [Updated dependencies](#update-dependencies)
* [Renamed master to main](#rename-master-to-main)

### New headless mode {#new-headless-mode}

In Chromium browsers, a "new headless" mode has been recently introduced. 
Read more details [in their blog](https://developer.chrome.com/articles/new-headless/).

Shortly said, it's a better headless mode that should fix all problems of the "old headless". 

In theory, you can still switch between the old and new headless modes.
But in practice, you will have to switch to a new one.
Because after last Chrome and Edge update, downloading files in the old headless mode stopped working.

Starting from Selenide 6.12.0, the new headless mode will be enabled by default. 

See [issue 2104](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/2104).
Thanks to [Boris Osipov](https://github.com/BorisOsipov) for [PR 2105](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2105)
and [PR 2169](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2169).

### Improve logging when downloading files {#improve-logs-when-downloading-file}
If file downloading failed (especially using method `FOLDER`), it's sometimes hard to understand why it failed.  
Now we improved logging inside of method `$.download()`, so the debugging should become easier. 

See [PR 2167](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2167).

### Improved downloading files in Edge on Windows {#improve-download-in-edge}

When downloading a file in Edge browser, Selenide tracks temporary files "*.crdownload". They are created by Chromium
engine during the download process.
Recently we realized that on Windows, Edge also creates temporary files "*.tmp". Now Selenide tracks them too. 

See [PR 2167](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2167).

Yes, these are echoes of that same BLM. One smart person convinced me that it's worth to rename the branch. :)

Well, why did I call this day _festive_?
It's because February, 24 is actually the Independence Day of Estonia.
105 years ago, Estonian troops expelled the invaders from the country and proclaimed a new independent state.

Without that brave guys on the armored train, there would be no Selenide now. :)
