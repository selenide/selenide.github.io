### Speed up collection checks {#speedup-collection-checks}

Here is the coolness!

One of basic Selenide features is collection checks. With just one line you can check a bunch of elements:

```java
$$("option").shouldHave(texts("Gandalf", "Gendalf", "Gondalf"))
```

But such a check can **take a significant time** in case of big collections.

For example, if a page has 1000 `<option>` elements, that check takes ~3 seconds on my machine.  
The slowness is due to the fact that Selenide fetches the text of each element separately.
1000 webdriver calls, even very fast ones, takes its time.

It's time to speed up those checks!

Now Selenide fetches texts of all 1000 elements **with a single webdriver call** using JavaScript.
> Now that check takes 200ms instead of 3 seconds.  
> It became 15 times faster!  
> _That's crazy._

P.S. For Appium and other webdriver not supporting JS, Selenide will fall back to the old implementation 
(fetches texts one-by-one). At least it's not worse than before.

See [PR 2362](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2362).

### Improved error messages in collection checks {#improve-collections-error-messages}

During the previous refactoring, we improved error message for collections. Now Selenide provides a more detailed error
of which element didn't meet the conditions: 

For example, this check:

```java
$$(".number").shouldHave(exactTexts("On", "Tw", "Thre"))
```

Reported just a simple `"Texts mismatch"` message:
```java
Texts mismatch
Actual: [One, Two, Three]
Expected: [On, Tw, Thre]
```

And now it specifies what exactly didn't match: 
```java
Text #0 mismatch (expected: "On", actual: "One")
Actual: [One, Two, Three]
Expected: [On, Tw, Thre]
```

See [PR 2362](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2362).

### New date checks `date(...)` and `datetime(...)` {#new-date-checks}

```java
import static com.codeborne.selenide.conditions.datetime.DateConditionOptions.*;

LocalDate birthday = LocalDate.of(2022, 10, 11);
$("#birthdate").shouldHave(date(birthday));
$("#birthdate").shouldHave(date(birthday, "yyyy-MM-dd"));
$("#birthdate").shouldHave(dateBetween(parse("2020-01-01"), parse("2023-12-31")));
$("#birthdate").shouldHave(dateFormat("yyyy-MM-dd"));
```

See [issue 2268](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/2268).
Thanks to [Maksim @Au6ojlut](https://github.com/Au6ojlut) for [PR 2281](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2281).

<br>

### New methods for setting time {#set-date-time-value}

Selenide had a method for selecting a date (`withDate`):

```java
$("#birthdate").setValue(withDate(LocalDate.of(...)));
// for <input type="date">
```

Now we have similar methods for selecting date and time (`withDateTime`):
```java
$("#birthdate").setValue(withDateTime(LocalDateTime.of(...)));
// for <input type="datetime-local">
```

or only time (`withTime`):
```java
$("#openFrom").setValue(withTime(LocalTime.of(7, 12)));
$("#closeFrom").setValue(withTime(LocalTime.of(17, 59, 58)));
// for <input type="time">
```
See [PR 2357](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2357).

<br>

### Full stacktrace in soft asserts {#full-stacktrace-in-soft-asserts}

In Selenide, you can enable soft asserts mode. Then Selenide will collect several failures during a test, and throw 
an exception in the end. This exception will include all collected assertion errors. 

The problem is that Selenide didn't show full stacktraces, so you couldn't see the "Caused by:" part. 
Now it will be shown.  
Be prepared for the lengthy stack traces :) 

See [issue 2350](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/2350) and [PR 2354](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2354).

<br>

### Improved BasicAuth in Chromium browsers {#improve-basic-auth-in-chromium-browsers}

Selenide has methods for BasicAuth authentication:
```java
open("/basic-auth/hello", "my.test.com", "scott", "pwd123");
```
Until now, we had two BasicAuth implementations.
1. If proxy is enabled: Selenide adds an `Authorization` header to every http request (`Basic YWRtaW460JrQsNC30LrQvtCy0LAg0LTRltCx0YDQvtCy0LA=`).
2. If proxy is disabled: Selenide adds login+password to URL (`https://scott:pwd123@localhost:42220/basic-auth/hello`).

Now we have a third implementation.
If webdriver implements interface `org.openqa.selenium.HasAuthentication`, then Selenide adds login+password via this interface.
Basically it means Chromium based browsers (Chrome, Chromium, Edge).

See [issue 2336](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/2336) and [PR 2358](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2358).

<br>

### Multiple domains in BasicAuth {#multiple-domains-in-basic-auth}
Until now, you could set only one domain for BasicAuth:
```java
open("/basic-auth/hello", "my.test.com", "scott", "pwd123");
```

It doesn't help if AUT uses multiple domains. For example, if AUT at address "https://my.test.com" opens a frame with address
"https://api.test.com" or, say, "https://api.test.com". You can set an empty domain, but
[it's not always safe](/2022/10/07/selenide-6.9.0/#secure-authorization-header).

Now you can set multiple domains separated by comma or "|":
```java
open("/basic-auth/hello", "my.test.com|auth.test.com|api.test.com", 
          "scott", "pwd123");
```

See [PR 2358](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2358).

P.S. Of course, the domain name is not used when Selenide adds the login+password just to the URL.

<br>

### Fixed `$.doubleClick()` in Appium {#fix-double-click-in-appium}

In a previous release we broke, and now we've fixed the double click in mobile phones:
```java
$(AppiumBy.xpath(".//android.widget.CheckBox")).doubleClick();
```

See [issue 2346](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/2346) and [PR 2347](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2347).

<br>

### Take screenshot earlier {#screenshot-before-after-each}
Usually Selenide takes a screenshot after a test failure.  
BUT
If you close the browser in `@AfterEach` method, Selenide could not take the screenshot anymore:
```java
@AfterEach
void tearDown() {
  Selenide.closeWebDriver();
}
```

Now Selenide will take the screenshot earlier - BEFORE all `@AfterEach` methods.

See [issue 2352](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/2352) and [PR 2356](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2356).
