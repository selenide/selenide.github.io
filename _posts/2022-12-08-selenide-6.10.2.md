# Good evening!

We got mini-release [Selenide 6.10.2](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/milestone/171?closed=1).

* [Added method $.press()](#added-method-press)
* [Trigger change event in $.select*](#trigger-change-events-by-select-methods)
* [selectOption in reports](#friendly-select-option-in-reports)
* [localStorage in reports](#friendly-local-storage-in-reports)
* [News](#news)
{: .blogpost-menu}


### Добавили метод `$.press()` {#added-method-press}

It's essentially the same ss  `sendKeys()`, but it's not `void`. You can _chain_ it with other methods:
```java
$("#username")
  .press("x")
  .press(TAB, CONTROL, ALT, ENTER)
  .should(disappear);
```

Thanks to [Amuthan Sakthivel](https://github.com/amuthansakthivel) for [PR 2032](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2032).

### Trigger `change` event by method `$.select*` {#trigger-change-events-by-select-methods}

As you remember, in previous release we [reworked working with selects using JavaScript](/2022/11/21/selenide-6.10.0/#select-options-using-javascript).
But we forgot to trigger `focus`, `click` and `change` events. Now we trigger them.

See [issue 2050](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/2050).
Thanks to [Vicente Rossello Jaume](https://github.com/cocorossello) for [PR 2051](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2051).

### Show `$.selectOption()` friendly in reports {#friendly-select-option-in-reports}

Another minor issue caused by the refactoring of selects: these operations look ugly in reports.  
That's because Java arrays don't have standard method `toString()`, and developers have to re-invent the wheel. 

Before:
```
| #blockChannel     | select option([TV Rain, [Ljava.lang.String;@6732726])     | PASS       | 487        |
```

After:
```
| #blockChannel     | select option(TV Rain)     | PASS       | 487        |
```

See [issue 2047](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/2047) and [PR 2052](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2052).

<br>

### Show `localStorage` friendly in reports {#friendly-local-storage-in-reports}

Similar problem with `sessionStorage` and `localStorage`: they look unreadable in reports. 

Before:
```
| com.codeborne.selenide.LocalStorage@138a952f    | set item(['Bout', 9125])     |
| com.codeborne.selenide.SessionStorage@549w123gg | set item(['Griner', 3285]) |
```

After:
```
| localStorage            | set item(['Bout', 9125])      |
| sessionStorage          | set item(['Griner', 3285])  |
```

See [issue 2045](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/2045) and [PR 2046](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2046).
