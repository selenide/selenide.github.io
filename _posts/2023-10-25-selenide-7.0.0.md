### Updated to Java 17 {#java17}

Wow!  
This day came!

To use Selenide 7.+, you will need to compile & run your tests with Java 17+.  

How cool is that, right?

I know some of you don't like this decision. You are still forced to run tests on Java 8.


But we are not guilty. As you know, Selenium 4.14+ upgraded from Java 8 to Java 11. 
So it was not possible to stay on Java 8 anyway. You have to update to Java 11 at least. 

Now, there is a very simple reasoning. In any Java project, the most complex update is from Java 8 to Java 11. 
Compared to this, updating from Java 11 to Java 17 is much more simple. There is nothing to do there, really. 

So just update your Java! 
> Life is too short to continue fiddling with Java 8

See [PR 2522](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2522).

### Fixed static initialization deadlock {#fix-deadlock-in-static-initialization}

This was an old potential problem in Selenide: class `Condition` and any of its subclasses depended on each other.  
Therefore, under certain circumstances, a deadlock could occur when these classes were loaded simultaneously.
Very unlikely, but theoretically possible.

> More details about [static initialization deadlock](https://blog.palantir.com/using-static-analysis-to-prevent-java-class-initialization-deadlocks-c2f31ca967d6).

To fix the problem, we had to rename the base class `Condition` to `WebElementCondition`. 
1. Don't worry, all your `Condition.visible` imports will remain unchanged. 
2. But if you have custom conditions, you will need to replace `extends Condition` by `extends WebElementCondition`.

See [issue 2372](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/2372) and [PR 2453](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2453).

<br>

### Actual value at the moment of check {#report-actual-value-at-the-moment-of-check}

Here we are talking not about web elements' checks, but ["new generation" checks](/2021/07/16/selenide-5.23.0/): url, localStorage etc.

```java
webdriver().shouldHave(url("https://some.com/page.html"));
localStorage().shouldHave(item("mouse", "Jerry”));
sessionStorage().shouldHave(itemWithValue("mouse", "Jerry”));
clipboard().shouldHave(content("Remember me"));
```

Shortly, we made the error message in  these checks more correct. 
Find details in [issue 2500](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/2500) and [PR 2501](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2501).

<br>

### Removed deprecated methods in `Condition` {#remove-deprecated-condition-methods}

Removed deprecated methods `apply()` and `actualValue()` in class `Condition`. 

This will only affect you if you wrote your own custom checks.
Now, instead of two methods `apply()` and `actualValue()`, you will need to implement only one method `check`.

See [PR 2512](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2512).

<br>

### Removed deprecated methods in `CollectionCondition` {#remove-deprecated-methods-from-collection-conditions}

Similarly to the previous change, it only affects you if you have custom checks for collections (`extends CollectionCondition`).
Instead of two methods `test` and `fail`, you need to implement only one method `check`. 

See [PR 2520](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2520).

<br>

### Removed deprecated methods in `ElementsCollection` {#remove-deprecated-methods-from-elements-collection}

Be prepared for the shock.  
Class `ElementsCollection` does **not extend** `java.util.List` anymore.
From the very beginning, this inheritance _occasionally_ added to `ElementsCollection` many unneeded methods 
(like `remove()`, `removeRange`, `clear`, `subList` and `listIterator()`) that we never intended to implement.  
But users sometimes did use them. And even complained that these methods didn't work.

Now we don't have these methods and don't have these problems.   
Now `$$` has only the methods we find useful. Amen.

P.S. If you have a loop over collection elements:
```java
  for (SelenideElement el : $$("#selenide-users .user")) {
    el.shouldBe(visible);
  }
```
then it doesn't compile anymore.

A **fast solution** is to add `asFixedIterable()` to `$$`:
```java
  for (SelenideElement el : $$("#selenide-users .user").asFixedIterable()) {
    el.shouldBe(visible);
  }
```

But the **right solution** is to rewrite this code and avoid the loop. Most probably, you would better write your 
   [custom collection condition](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/wiki/Custom-collection-conditions).

See [PR 2513](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2513).

<br>

### Replaced `FileNotFoundException` by `FileNotDownloadedError` {#replace-file-not-found-exception}

Before today, all methods like `$.download()` were declared as `throws FileNotFoundException`.
And you had to suffer adding this pointless `throws FileNotFoundException` to your tests.
Now you can clean up this trash and remove unnecessary `catch (FileNotFoundException)` if you had them.

Now methods like `$.download()` will throw `FileNotDownloadedError` which is inherited from `AssertionError`. 
You don't need to declare nor catch it.
If test could not download the file - test should fail.No additional processing is needed.

See [PR 2526](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2526).

<br>

### Renamed `*Exception` to `*Error` {#rename-exceptions-to-errors}

Personally, I don't think it matters at all.    
But some users didn't like that some of Selenide classes were named `*Exception`, but didn't extend `java.lang.Exception`.

Well, we respect all opinions. 
Now Selenide classes inherited from `java.lang.Error` are named `*Error`. 

See [issue 2485](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/2485) and [PR 2530](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2530).

<br>

### Removed support for deprecated `WebDriverEventListener` {#remove-deprecated-listener}

We removed all methods like `addListener()` with a parameter of type `org.openqa.selenium.support.events.WebDriverEventListener`.

This class has been deprecated in Selenium for a long time.

You should use `addListener()` with parameter `org.openqa.selenium.support.events.WebDriverListener` instead. 

See [PR 2516](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2516).

<br>

### Removed deprecated Drag'n'drop methods {#remove-deprecated-drag-and-drop-methods}

Yet another cleanup. Just replace  
```java
$("#what").dragAndDropTo(where);
```

by 
```java
$("#what").dragAndDrop(to(where));
```

See [PR 2519](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2519).

<br>

### Removed deprecated methods `$.getSelectedValue()` and `$.getSelectedText()` {#remove-deprecated-get-selected-value-methods}

One more cleanup.
1. Replace `$.getSelectedValue()` by `$.getSelectedOptionValue()`
2. Replace `$.getSelectedText()` by `$.getSelectedOptionText()`

See [PR 2521](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2521).

<br>

### Removed deprecated TestNG annotations `@Report` and `@GlobalTextReport` {#remove-deprecated-testng-annotations}

These annotations were not needed starting from [Selenide 6.7.0](https://selenide.org/2022/08/04/selenide-6.7.0/#cancel-report-testng-annotation).
Just remove them.
Yes, and delete TestNG, for that matter. ;) 

See [PR 2517](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2517).

<br>

### Other cleanup {#remove-other-deprecated-methods}
Few more cleanups:

1. Replace
```java
new BearerTokenCredentials("pwd")
```
by
```java
new BearerTokenCredentials("domain", "pwd")
```

2. Replace
```java
$.should(appears);
```
by
```java
$.should(appear);  // or just $.shouldBe(visible)
```
3. Replace

```java
Selenide.open(url, BASIC, "username", "password");
```
by
```java
Selenide.open(url, BASIC, new BasicAuthCredentials("username", "password"));
```
See [PR 2518](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2518).
