Hi all!

Urgently update to [Selenide 6.12.2](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/milestone/178?closed=1)!

It has one important workaround for Chromedriver 111 issue:

> Invalid Status code=403 text=Forbidden

### What's the problem?

Recently a new version of Chrome and Chromedriver was released: 111.

People who did upgrade their browser unexpectedly started getting test failures.  
Test tried to open the browser. The browser window appeared, but webdriver received an exception, and could not do
any following actions. In the end, test could not even close that browser! 

In logs, you could read only messages like this:

```java
Starting ChromeDriver 111.0.5563.64 on port 31021
org.openqa.selenium.remote.http.WebSocket$Listener onError
WARNING: Invalid Status code=403 text=Forbidden
java.io.IOException: Invalid Status code=403 text=Forbidden
...
```

Although it's a [bug in chromedriver]( https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromedriver/issues/detail?id=4361), 
it had a simple workaround, and we decided to add it to Selenide to avoid a bigger hassle in QA world. 

See [issue 2192](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/2192) and
[PR 2194](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2194).

> We recommend you upgrading to [HttpClient](/2023/03/22/selenide-6.12.4/#support-jdk-http-client).
Yes, it requires Java11+, but has better support etc.
