Long time no see, cats!

I wrote the last release notes in April. Since then, we have made a few releases, the most significant was [7.4.0](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/milestone/208?closed=1). 

But now it's time to upgrade to [Selenide 7.5.0](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/milestone/212?closed=1):

* [New configuration for every browser](#new-configuration-for-every-browser)
* [Fixed events in selects](#raise-bubbleable-events-from-selects)
* [Shorter API for downloading files](#builder-methods-for-download-options)
* [Don't close windows when downloading files](#do-not-close-windows-when-downloading-file)
* [Don't catch all Errors anymore](#do-not-catch-all-errors)
* [Fixed custom error formatters](#generate-error-details-during-error-construction)
* [Updated dependencies](#update-dependencies)
* [Statistics](#statistics)

### New configuration for every browser {#new-configuration-for-every-browser}

Selenide has one nuance that might not be obvious to newcomers: all settings in `Configuration` class are _static_. 
When you change any setting in one test, it affects other tests as well. It may be especially important when running tests in parallel. 


This is, so to speak, not a bug, but a feature: `Configuration` contains settings that, it seems, do not need to be changed from test to test.
And those values ​​that can actually be different, we have long ago taken out into the parameters of different methods:
  * `$.click(usingJavaScript());   // instead of Configuration.clickViaJs = true`
  * `$.download(using(PROXY));   // instead of Configuration.fileDownload = PROXY`

I wrote more about this evolution [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KGtZoFVzr8&list=PL9Z-JgiTsOYRfoG_mcRBlTUIFPIknhQ6S&ab_channel=ConfEngine).

But there was one more setting left: `Configuration.browserCapabilities`.
Sometimes you need to set different capabilities in different tests - for example, to set the name of a video in Selenoid. 

Strictly speaking, this was possible before as well - just by running the webdriver from your code with any necessary settings.  
But now they can be set directly in the `open` method:

```java
@Test void testWithoutProxy() {
  open("/one", new SelenideConfig().proxyEnabled(false).fileDownload(FOLDER));
  File report = $("#report").download();
}

@Test void testWithProxy() {
  open("/two", new SelenideConfig().proxyEnabled(true).fileDownload(PROXY));
  File cv = $("#cv").download();
}
```

Be careful not to overuse it.

NB! When you call method `open(url, config)`, and some browser was already opened by that moment (apparently by a previous test), then Selenide will close this browser.
This may slow down your tests due to constant reopening of browsers. Keep this in mind.

See [issue 1372](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1372) and [PR 2846](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2846).

### Fixed events in selects {#raise-bubbleable-events-from-selects}

In [Selenide 7.4.2](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/releases/tag/v7.4.2) we improved working with `<select>`s in Vue.js:
started throwing `input` events in addition to `change`.
But we accidentally changed the events themselves: they were no longer "bubbleable".
That broke the processing of selects in some other frameworks (when the `change` event handler is bound not to select itself, but to its parent).

Now we fixed it. You can again choose options in your favorite selects in preferred way:

* `$("#migrants").selectOption("Abduct neighbours' pets");`
* `$("#migrants").selectOptionContainingText("abbed ducks by their nec");`
* `$("#migrants").selectOption(2);`
* `$("#migrants").selectOptionByValue("kill-ducks-from-parks");`

See [issue 2832](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/2832) and [PR 2835](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2835).

### Shorter API for downloading files {#builder-methods-for-download-options}

To download a ".txt", you had to write quite a long expression:
```java
File f = $.download(using(FOLDER).withFilter(withExtension("txt")));
```

No you can shorten it:  
```java
import static com.codeborne.selenide.DownloadOptions.file;

File f = $.download(file().withExtension("txt")));
```

In general, the algorithm is very easy: just write `download(file().` - and after the period, available options pop up.

### Don't close windows when downloading files {#do-not-close-windows-when-downloading-file}

Here is the story.   
Selenide provides 4 methods for downloading files (HTTPGET, FOLDER, PROXY, CDP), and two of them (FOLDER, PROXY) work
on this principle:
1. Click the link
2. Wait for the file
3. If some tabs/windows have been opened after click - close them
4. Return the file

And now we have come to the understanding that the third step is not really necessary.
Nobody even remembers why it was originally added. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Now Selenide will not even try to close any windows.  
If you have a problem with this - contact us, we will discuss the details. :) 

See [issue 2836](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/2836) and [PR 2840](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2840).

### Don't catch all Errors anymore {#do-not-catch-all-errors}

And again we break the basics. :)  
The main _algorithm of Selenide_ is basically a try/catch in a loop (up to 4 seconds timeout).
And here the crucial question: which exception should we catch inside this "try/catch"? 

For many years, there was `catch (Error error)`. By all accounts, this is bad practice in Java. :)
Nobody remembers exactly why. Maybe it was because of Internet Explorer, which used to throw `java.lang.Error` in case of invalid XPath.

The problem is that this `catch (Error error)` can hide serious problems, in which the test should not retry in the loop, but immediately fail. 
Something like OutOfMemory errors. 

Now we don't catch `Error`s anymore and hope that it will not break your tests, because Internet Explorer has long since sunk into oblivion. 

See [PR 2845](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2845).

### Fixed custom error formatters {#generate-error-details-during-error-construction}

Oh, never mind, too lazy to describe it. :)  
If you override class `SelenideErrorFormatter`,
then read [issue 2830](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/2830) and [PR 2839](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2839).
