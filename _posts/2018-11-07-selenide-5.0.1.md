Good morning!
A month has passed since the release of Selenide 5.0.0. We haven't got any bug reports. :)

So, we have released Selenide 5.0.1 with minor fixes for old issues. 

# Generate random file name for downloaded file 

As you know, Selenide has a method for direct file download by link:

```java
File image = Selenide.download("https://utdirect.utexas.edu/apps/pts/parking/citations/nlogon/images/6584836/");
``` 

It tries to get file name from http header or url. If neither is present (as in example above), it failed. 
Now it doesn't fail anymore, but generates a random file name. Though I would consider it as the application bug.

See [issue 840](https://github.com/codeborne/selenide/issues/840) and [PR 856](https://github.com/codeborne/selenide/pull/856).

Thanks to [David Phillips](https://github.com/fyrewall77) for a solution idea.

# Fixed `IndexOutOfBounds` when parent element is not found

This line caused `IndexOutOfBounds` before, but now it returns `false`:

```java
$$("not-existing-locator").first().$$("locator").isEmpty();
``` 

See [issue 747](https://github.com/codeborne/selenide/issues/747).

Thanks to [Denys Shynkarenko](https://github.com/Denysss) for [PR 837](https://github.com/codeborne/selenide/pull/837).

# Fixed `ClassCastException` in method `$$.toArray()`

This code caused `ClassCastException` before:

```java
List<SelenideElement> selenideElements = new ArrayList<>();
selenideElements.addAll($$("#table1 td"));
```

I don't even want to know why somebody should need such code in tests... But well, we had to fix it, and we fixed it.
 
See [issue 844](https://github.com/codeborne/selenide/issues/844).

Thanks to [Boris Osipov](https://github.com/BorisOsipov) for [PR 847](https://github.com/codeborne/selenide/pull/847).

# Added support for chrome 70

Starting from version 3.0, WebDriverManager became flaky. It contains file `versions.properties` which
matches versions of webdrivers and browsers. But WDM gets updates much less frequently than browsers and webdrivers.
Naturally, every time when new version of Firefox or Chrome gets released, WDM doesn't support it. 

By now, we added own version of `versions.properties` to Selenide. Selenide is updated more frequently than WDM. :)
 
We already added chrome70=2.42 and firefox62 there. 
We need your ideas how to deal with it in future. Feel free to share your thought! 

See [PR 855](https://github.com/codeborne/selenide/pull/855).

## Conferences

If you haven't been yet, I recommend to go to [Heisenbug conference](https://heisenbug-moscow.ru/2018/msk/people/) in Moscow (December 2019).

It's a really great conference. Believe me, I have been there last year.
