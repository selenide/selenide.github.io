Good evening!

Today is August, 24 - Ukraine Independence Day.    
And in honor of this holiday - a small release [Selenide 6.17.2](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/milestone/189?closed=1).

<br>

### Un-hanged the hanging webdriver. Again.
[In the previous release](/2023/08/20/selenide-6.17.1/), we fixed the problem with hanging webdriver _for most users_.  
But the unfortunate ones remained, who are forced to open the tested sites in Chrome through BasicAuth. 
For these users, webdriver still hangs.

What was left for us? We had to revert [CDP-based authentication](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2358) until the
 [webdriver issue](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/issues/12576) gets fixed.

### How to reproduce the problem
If you want to reproeuce the problem, run this test: 

```java
  public class BasicAuthTest {
    @RepeatedTest(2)
    void this_snippet_hangs_during_second_run() {
      open("https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/basic_auth", BASIC, 
           new BasicAuthCredentials("the-internet.herokuapp.com", "admin", "admin"));

      $("#content").shouldHave(text("Congratulations!"));
    }
  }
```

The first run works, the second run hangs. On Selenide 6.17.1.

And on Selenide 6.17.2 it doesn't freeze anymore. Hooray.
