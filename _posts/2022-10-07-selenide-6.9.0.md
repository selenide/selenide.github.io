# Yo Seleniders!

Let me break your doomscrolling with some good news. 

We released [Selenide 6.9.0](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/milestone/166?closed=1)!
Basically, they pumped proxies and updated selenium.

* [Fake server response in proxy](#proxy-mock-response)
* [Authorization header](#secure-authorization-header)
* [Improve proxy host name](#resolve-proxy-hostname)
* [Upgrade to Selenium 4.5.0](#upgrade-to-selenium-4.5.0)
* [Drop Opera support](#remove-opera-support)
* [News](#news)

### Now Selenide proxy can mock server response {#proxy-mock-response}

As you know, Selenide can run its own embedded proxy server. It listens requests between browser and other world.
We mostly used it in read-only mode (logging, downloading files). But now you can also change the traffic.
Namely, you can replace server response. It may be useful to mock the response of some service.

Let's look at some simple abstract example.

#### Example


Let's say you're testing a site showing the results of a referendum. 
It's a html page on address, say, https://referendum.ru, which calls service https://cik.ru to fetch json with voting results. 

Since the results are not known in advance, but the site needs to be tested here and now, we want to check how it will
look in different corner cases. 

#### Test
```java
open();
getSelenideProxy().responseMocker().mockText("cik-mock",
    urlStartsWith(GET, "https://cik.ru/api/gov/no/referendum"), 
    () -> "{votes: 2133326, for: 99.23, against: 0.77}");

open("https://referendum.ru");
$("#votesFor").shouldHave(text("99.23%"));
$("#h3").shouldHave(text("not only satisfy but also surprised"));
```

#### Explanation
Look at the first parameter `cik-mock`. This is *name* of the mock.  
You can use it later to cancel the mock (to avoid occasional effects on the following tests):
```java
@AfterEach
void tearDown() {
  getSelenideProxy().responseMocker().reset("cik-mock");
}
```

Or you can just cancel all the mocks for safety:

```java
@AfterEach
void tearDown() {
  getSelenideProxy().responseMocker().resetAll();
}
```

#### Constraints
If you site and mocked service run on same domain, there is no constraints.  
But if the site calls a service on another domain, mock will work only if
* both site and mock run on https (not http)
* service is alive and accessible from proxy

#### In sum
Using mocks is a powerful technique letting us verify different corner cases that are hard or even impossible to reproduce otherwise   
("146% votes for", "no one showed up to vote", "service is unavailable" etc.)

> It will work as you want.

### Send authorization header only to specified domain {#secure-authorization-header}

Some site you need to test are protected by BasicAuth.
Selenide allows to open such sites with overloaded method `open`:
```java
open("https://referendum.ru/admin", BASIC, 
             new BasicAuthCredentials("saver-of-the-world", "gojda!!!"));
```

This method can overcome BasicAuth:
* if proxy is not enabled - by adding login/password to URL, 
* and if proxy is enabled - by adding http header `Authorization` to requests from browser to server. 

But here's the problem. Recently we realized that Selenide sent `Authorization` header not only to the app under test,
but also to all other services (e.g. S3 or Google authentication).

Now Selenide will send `Authorization` only to needed domain. But you will also need to specify the domain in constructor:

```java
open("https://referendum.ru/admin", BASIC, 
             new BasicAuthCredentials("referendum.ru", "saver-of-the-world", "gojda!!!"));
```

See [issue 1974](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1974) and [PR 1975](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1975).

### Improved resolving proxy host name {#resolve-proxy-hostname}

When you enable proxy in Selenide (e.g. by setting `Configuration.proxyEnabled = true`), 
it will run embedded proxy server on random port. And open a browser with instructions to use proxy `HOST:PORT`.
The question is, which HOST to use?

Until now, we used expression `ClientUtil.getConnectableAddress()` to resolve the host name (it's default behaviour of BrowserUpProxy). 
But from this release, we will use `new NetworkUtils().getNonLoopbackAddressOfThisMachine()` (it's Selenium internal method).
I'm too lazy to figure out what their specifics are, but they may return different results on my machine:
* `new NetworkUtils().getNonLoopbackAddressOfThisMachine()` -> `192.168.0.18`
* `ClientUtil.getConnectableAddress()` -> `127.0.0.1`

The first one is definitely better when the browser runs on different machine or in a container.
The proxy will just not be accessible by address `127.0.0.1` from other machine.

> If none expression works properly for you, you can always specify host name explicitly by setting 
> `Configuration.proxyHost = "my.comp.eu";`

### Upgraded to Selenium 4.5.0 {#upgrade-to-selenium-4.5.0}

Notable changes:
* dropped support for Opera browser
* added alternative implementation of webdriver transport using JDK 11 HTTP client instead of Netty client
* added checks for `disabled` in class `Select` (now you cannot select a disabled options anymore)
* removed host name from Selenium exceptions
> arrr, I asked for this change [since 2015](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/issues/489)!!!

See [changelog](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/trunk/java/CHANGELOG) and 
[PR 1967](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1967).

<br>

### Removed support for Opera browser {#remove-opera-support}

As a consequence of the Selenium upgrade, we also had to drop Opera support. I guess the reason is that Opera uses 
Chrome engine and is not very different from Chrome. If you still need to run tests in Opera - it's possible, just
use chromedriver.

See [PR 1967](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1967).

<br>

### Removed `getAlias` from reports {#do-not-log-get-alias}

Thanks to [Reserved Word](https://github.com/reserved-word) for [PR 1971](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1971).

<br>

### Restored setting "connection timeout" {#restore-setting-connection-timeout}

Few people need this, so feel free to skip it.

We used to have two settings for the webdriver http client: "connection timeout" and "read timeout".
The first one had to be removed when upgrading to Selenium 4, because it was cut out there.
Now it was resuscitated in Selenium 4.5.0, well, so we resuscitated also.

### Upgraded dependencies {#update-dependencies}

* LittleProxy from 2.0.12 to 2.0.13
* slf4j from 2.0.2 to 2.0.3

Not only IT people suffer from [constantly changing requirements](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=laIGavOMcw8&ab_channel=FoilArmsandHog)!
