# Hello, people!

<br>
We released [Selenide 6.3.0](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/milestone/143?closed=1).

Let's review what's changed?

<br>

# Added methods `switchTo().frame(timeout)` with custom timeout

Selenide has methods `switchTo().frame(name)` for switching between frames. As usually, with built-in waiting and other bonuses.  
But what if the frame is being loaded longer than the default timeout (4 seconds)?  

Now you can pass an additional parameter `Duration` - the timeout for switching into the frame:

```java
  switchTo().frame("ifrm");                          // waits up to default timeout (4 seconds)
  switchTo().frame("ifrm", Duration.ofSeconds(6));   // waits up to 6 seconds
```

Thanks to [@donesvad](https://github.com/donesvad) for [PR 1722](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1722).

# Added selectors `byTagAndText` and `withTagAndText`

Selenide has method for finding elements by text:
```java
  import static com.codeborne.selenide.Selectors.*;

  $(byText("Hello world")).shouldHave(text("Hello World"));
  $(withText("Hello")).shouldHave(text("Hello World"));
```

But sometimes it's not enough: if there are multiple elements with given text, and you need to pick one of them by tag. 

Now Selenide has methods for find by tag and text:

```java
  import static com.codeborne.selenide.Selectors.*;

  $(byTagAndText("h1", "Hello world")).shouldHave(text("Hello World"));
  $(withTagAndText("h1", "Hello")).shouldHave(text("Hello World"));
```

Thanks to [Maurizio Lattuada](https://github.com/maurizio-lattuada ) for  [issue 1650](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1650) and [PR 1651](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1651).

<br>

# Fixed bug in `byTextCaseInsensitive`

Now this selector ignores leading/trailing spaces and newlines in the text (like the canonical `byText`).

See [issue 1723](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1723) and [PR 1724](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1724).

<br>

# Added records "webdriver create" and "webdriver close" to report

If you use Selenide's `TextReport` or plugin `AllureSelenide`, you are used to see the report in the end of every test.  
The report shows all the performed steps: open a page - find an element - click etc. 

Now the report also shows moments when the webdriver was created or closed. This information may be useful when 
debugging some problems with tests.

Thanks to [Petro Ovcharenko](https://github.com/petroOv-PDFfiller) for [PR 1715](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1715).

# Fixed overriding of Selenium timeout

In [Selenide 5.22.0](/2021/06/08/selenide-5.22.0/) we introduced a hack for overriding Selenium webdriver timeout from (unreasonably long) 3 hours to 2 minutes.  

But this hack was broken after upgrade to Selenium 4 (as it always happens to all hacks). 
Now we reanimated it.  

Let me remind that Selenide now has the following timeouts in communication between tests and webdriver:
* connect timeout - 10 seconds
* read timeout - 1.5 minutes

See [commit cf02da5](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/commit/cf02da5).

<br>

# Removed duplicate wrapping of "Element not found"

See [issue 1705](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1705) and [PR 1706](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1706).

<br>

# Added support for authentication type `BEARER`

Selenide has several types of authentication:
```java
open("/basic-auth/hello", BASIC, "scott", "tiger");
```

but only `BASIC` did really work. Nobody ever tested the other types. :)

And we found that `BEARER` type didn't work. Now we fixed it.  

This is how you can use it:

```java
    open("/bearer-token-auth/hello", BEARER, new BearerTokenCredentials("token-123"));
```

See [PR 1714](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1714).

<br>

# Now Selenide treats empty settings like `selenide.remote` as undefined

This change should make devops' life easier. 
When configuring CI pipelines and jobs, you often use variables to set Selenide settings:

```
-Dselenide.remote=${env.GRID_URL}
``` 

If `GRID_URL` variable is not set in some environment, Selenide failed because it tried to parse empty url to set `selenide.remote`.  

Now Selenide will treat empty setting like `selenide.remote` just undefined and continue work as usually (like `selenide.remote` was never set).  

See [Alexei Vinogradov](https://github.com/vinogradoff) for [issue 1656](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1656) and [Boris Osipov](https://github.com/BorisOsipov) for [PR 1663](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1663).

# Upgraded to Selenium 4.1.2

A heard some users experienced problems with Guava version after upgrading to Selenium 4.1.2. Selenide defined Guava version 
explicitly, so generally you should not experience such a problem. If you still get something like `NoSuchMethodError`, please 
verify the guava version: pribably it's overridden by some Gradle or Maven plugin. Please refer the old good [post about resolving dependencies](/2020/11/17/why-proxy-does-not-work-in-selenoid/) if needed.

See [Selenium changelog](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/trunk/java/CHANGELOG) and [PR 1719](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1719).

# UPD Selenide 6.3.1
Minor update [Selenide 6.3.1](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/milestone/146?closed=1):
* [#1731](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1731) we restored possibility to use soft asserts in TestNG in methods `@Before*` and `@After*` (we occasionally forbidden them it Selenide 6.2.0) - see [PR #1732](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1732)
* [#1729](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1729) Upgraded from Netty 4.1.73.Final to 4.1.74.Final


<br>

# UPD Selenide 6.3.2
Another update [Selenide 6.3.2](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/milestone/147?closed=1):
* [#1733](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1733) Added a workaround for Selenium bug [10345](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/issues/10345), which caused failure of method `FirefoxDriver.close()` after upgrading to Firefox 97.
* [#1736](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1736) Upgraded from BrowserUpProxy 2.1.3 to 2.1.4
* [#1611](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1611) Upgraded Java version from 8 to 17.

Let me explain the Java update. Now Selenide project is built with Java 17, but the generated binaries `selenide-*.jar`
are targeted to Java 8. This allows
* Selenide developers use all the latest Java features, and
* Selenide users still run their tests on Java 8 (though we recommend upgrading Java, of course).

It became possible thanks to the tool [Jabel](https://github.com/bsideup/jabel) and personally [
Sergei Egorov](https://github.com/bsideup) who came up with this elegant hack
(and also involved in [TestContainers](https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java) and [AtomicJar](https://www.atomicjar.com/)).

<br>

# UPD Selenide 6.3.3

* #1740 upgraded to WebDriverManager 5.1.0

<br>

* #1748 fixed module name in generated Selenide binaries

<br>

# UPD Selenide 6.3.5
Another update [Selenide 6.3.5](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/milestone/150?closed=1):
* [#1755](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1755) fix file download via proxy in case of encoded response  -  see [PR #1756](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1756)
