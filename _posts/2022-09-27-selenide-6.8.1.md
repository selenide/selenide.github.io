# Gooda!

Catch min-bugfix [Selenide 6.8.1](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/milestone/165?closed=1).

This only applies to those who directly call in their tests 
```java
new RemoteWebDriver(url, options)
```
and encountered `NoClassDefFoundError` after upgrading to [Selenide 6.8.0](/2022/09/24/selenide-6.8.0/).

### Prehistory {#pre-history}

What is OpenTelemetry?
This is some kind of thing that was added to Selenium 4 for some reason, but nobody really knows why it's needed
and how to use it. :) In fact, no one cares, no one uses it. :)  

In Selenide, we also removed it in [PR 1763](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1763).

> OpenTelemetry dependency in Selenium is like Special Military Operation: nobody knows why it's needed. 

### The problem {#the-problem}

So, most Selenide users don't have such a problem. 

BUT
you might into trouble if you call constructor `new RemoteWebDriver(url, options)` in your tests. 
Unfortunately, it requires OpenTelemetry dependency. And after upgrading to [Selenide 6.8.0](/2022/09/24/selenide-6.8.0/) 
these users might get `NoClassDefFoundError`.

<br/>

### Temporary solution {#temporary-solution}

Add parameter `false` to the constructor: `new RemoteWebDriver(url, options, false)`.
This `false` says "please don't user telemetry".

<br/>

### Demobilized OpenTelemetry dependency {#restored-opentelemetry}

In short, we quickly released Selenide 6.8.1, which brought back OpenTelemetry.

See [issue 1965](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1965) and [PR 1966](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1966).
