### Added video recorder {#video-recorder}

Finally!

We all encounter unstable tests. Blinking tests. **Flaky tests**.  
> If this topic is new to you, I envy you. You are in for a fascinating dive into    
[Flaky Tests](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18J2_4a4Cl4&ab_channel=Jfokus).

When investigating flaky tests, videos may be very helpful. And now Selenide can save videos from tests out of the box.

> Few years ago, we used to use the [VideoRecorder](https://github.com/SergeyPirogov/video-recorder-java) library by Sergey Pirogov a lot.
> But now Sergey is assembling drones for the Ukrainian Armed Forces and is not working on open source for the time being.
> Such are the times. :(

**How to start recording videos?**

It's easy.
1. Replace dependency `selenide:7.6.0` by `selenide-video-recorder:7.6.0`
2. Add extension `org.selenide.videorecorder.junit5.VideoRecorderExtension` to your tests (in case of JUnit5)
3. Add listener `org.selenide.videorecorder.testng.VideoRecorderListener` to your tests (in case, God forgive me, TestNG)
4. Add annotation `@Video` to your unstable tests (there aren't many of them, are there?)

**Now** Selenide starts recording videos for all annotated tests.   
BUT  
the videos will be saved only when a test fails. A link to the video will be added to the error message - just as link to a screenshot.

```java
Element should have text "Oreshnik"
Actual value: text="Kokoshnik"

Screenshot: file:/.../build/reports/tests/1732761758509.0.png
Page source: file:/.../build/reports/tests/1732761758509.0.html
Video: file:/.../build/reports/tests/1732761754743.0.webm
```

**How it works?**

Before every annotated test, Selenide starts 2 threads:
1. Regularly takes screenshots from web browser and stores in a queue (just in memory for now)
2. Merges the screenshots to a video (using library `org.bytedeco:javacv`)

After the test, the video is either deleted or saved to a file, and attached to the error message.

<br>
P.S. The abovementioned behaviour and some parameters can be configured in file `selenide.properties`, see 
[VideoConfiguration](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/blob/main/modules/video-recorder/src/main/java/org/selenide/videorecorder/core/VideoConfiguration.java).

<br>
NB! Keep in mind that video recording consumes resources and slows down your computer. Use sparingly.

### Added `because` for webdriver conditions {#add-because-for-webdriver-conditions}

Now you can write not just:
```java
webdriver().shouldHave(numberOfWindows(2)));
webdriver().shouldHave(url("https://dictionary.cambridge.org")));
```

but with an explanation:
```java
webdriver().shouldHave(
  numberOfWindows(2).because("The login page should open in a new window"));

webdriver().shouldHave(
  url("https://dictionary.cambridge.org/").because("WTF is Oreshnik?"));
```

Thanks to [Daniil Moiseev](https://github.com/DaniilMoiseevPenza) for [PR 2853](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2853).

<br>

### Added method `$.scrollIntoCenter()` {#scroll-into-center}

It's essentially the same as `$.scrollIntoView("{block: 'center'}")` but shorter.  

Because in most cases, when we scroll, that's exactly what we want. 

```java
  $("#logout")
    .scrollIntoCenter()
    .shouldHave(text("A murky button somewhere at the bottom of the screen"))
    .click();
```
See [PR 2842](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2842).

<br>

### Special space characters support {#support-special-space-characters}

When we search a web element by text, or verify the element's text, we usually need to ignore spaces.  

According to the HTML specification, several consecutive spaces are considered as one space. 

Until now, Selenide treated several whitespace characters in this way (`<space>`, `<tab>`, `&nbsp;`, `<newline>`).
But it turned out that there are many more different distorted spaces (so-called "En Space", "Em Space", "Three-Per-Em Space" etc.).
Now we can ignore them all. :)

For example, for a web page like this:
```html
<div id="hero">
  Ahoo &#32; &nbsp; &ensp; &emsp; &numsp; &NoBreak; &puncsp; 
  &ThinSpace; &VeryThinSpace; &MediumSpace; Daryae
</div>
```

The following test will work:
```java
  $("#hero").shouldHave(text("Ahoo Daryae"));

  $(byText("Ahoo Daryae")).ancestor().shouldHave(
    text("Say Her Name"));
```

Thanks to [Daniil Moiseev](https://github.com/DaniilMoiseevPenza) for [PR 2858](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2858).  
See also [PR 2884](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2884).

<br>

### Fixed `inNewBrowser` with custom configuration {#fix-in-new-browser-with-custom-config}

This is rarely used, so don't bother. But I have to mention it. 

First of all, we added method `inNewBrowser` with `config` parameter for opening a new browser with custom configuration:

```java
inNewBrowser(Config config, Runnable lambda)
```

Second, we fixed the existing method `inNewBrowser(Runnable lambda)` which didn't restore the previous config if the browser was closed inside it. 

See [issue 2859](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/2859) and [PR 2902](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2902).

<br>

### Fixed appium page factory {#fix-appium-page-factory}

Fixed bug in `selenide-appium` when a test tried to create page object for website, not mobile app. 
And website was not opened yet. 

Thanks to [Petro Ovcharenko](https://github.com/PetroOv) for [PR 2879](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2879).

<br>

### Reduced the number of Selenide logs {#less-selenide-logs}

We reviewed Selenide logs and converted some "info" logs into "debug".  
In other words, there should be less spam in the logs now.   
If you need to debug some complex problem, turn on the "debug" level. ;)

See [PR 2892](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2892).

<br>

### Fixed `Selenide.screenshot(filename)` behaviour {#fix-screenshot-behaviour}

In javadoc of this method, it was mentioned that it creates two files - "*.html" and "*.png". But in reality it created only "*.png".
Now the behaviour of this method matches the description in javadoc. 

See [issue 2896](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/2896) and [PR 2901](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2901).

<br>

### JSR305 -> JSpecify {#jspecify}

Many Selenide methods were annotated with `@Nullable`, `@Nonnull`, `@CheckReturnValue`, `@ParametersAreNonnullByDefault`.  
This is useful to help you avoid some typical bugs. Thanks to these annotations, IDE can highlight this code with a warning:

```java
  $("h1");   // Ooops, somebody forgot a check: .shouldBe(visible)
```
Until now, we took these annotations from library "JSR 305" (the annotations were imported from package `javax.annotation`).  
But this library is not supported anymore.And recently a new library [JSpecify](https://jspecify.dev/) was released to replace it.
Now Selenide migrated to JSpecify. The annotations are now imported from packages `org.jspecify.annotations` and `com.google.errorprone.annotations`.

See [PR 2889](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2889).

<br>

### Simplified custom commands {#simplify-custom-commands}

If you created a subclass from `Click`, `SetValue` or some other Selenide built-in command, then we accidentally broke
your backwards compatibility. Sorry. :)

Now instead of method 
```java
public SelenideElement execute(SelenideElement proxy, WebElementSource locator, Object [] args) { ... }
```

you need to implement/override method 
```java
protected void execute(WebElementSource locator, Object @Nullable [] args) { ... }
```
But it's shorter and simpler this way, right?

But in general, if your project compiles, then don't worry, it doesn't concern you. :)

See [issue 2906](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/2906) and [PR 2889](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2889).
