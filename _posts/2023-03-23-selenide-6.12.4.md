### Workaround for Chromedriver {#workaround-for-chromedriver-bug}
Reminder: if you still are looking for a solution for
> Invalid Status code=403 text=Forbidden

then it was released in [Selenide 6.12.2](/2023/03/09/selenide-6.12.2/).

<br>

### Added support for `jdk-http-client` as a replacement for `netty-client` {#support-jdk-http-client}

By default, Selenide still uses old good `netty-client`, but if you wish to  
[upgrade to jdk-http-client](https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2022/using-java11-httpclient/), 
now you can easily do that:
1. Add dependency:  
`org.seleniumhq.selenium:selenium-http-jdk-client:$seleniumVersion`
2. Add system property before opening a browser:     
`System.setProperty("webdriver.http.factory", "jdk-http-client");`

See [issue 2215](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/2215)
and [PR 2216](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2216).

<br>

### Restored proxy after using `using` {#restore-proxy-after-using}

It's almost the same problem as [issue 2202](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/2202),
but with Selenide built-in proxy. 

If you enabled a proxy in your tests, once you used method `using`, the proxy disappeared. 
The following downloading of files (or any other featured you used proxy for) didn't work anymore.

Now `using` method has been fixed. See more details about this [very convenient method `using`](/2019/10/16/selenide-5.4.0/#add-method-using).

See [PR 2208](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2208) and 
[PR 2209](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2209).

<br>

### Fixed `$.clear()` when element disappears {#fix-clear-when-element-disappears}

As you know, Selenide has method `$("input").clear()` that clears given input field.  
But it could fail in one specific situation: when the input disappears as a result of clearing.  
At this moment, method `$.clear()` tried to trigger `change` event on this input - and failed.

See [issue 2207](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/2207) and
[PR 2221](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2221).
