Good quarantine!

It was the third day of quarantine.   

To make you feel not so lonely, we released [Selenide 5.10.0](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/milestone/93?closed=1) with
 a bunch of improvements. Some of them are even slightly backward incompatible. Well, so you do not get bored in your dens. 

* [Added support for Shadow DOM](#add-shadow-dom-support)
* [Don't fetch BrowserUpProxy by default](#exclude-bup-by-default)
* [Replace Guava APIs by Java APIs](#replace-guava)
* [Made Selenide Allure report nicer](#add-quotes-to-report)
* [Added condition shouldBe(image)](#add-image-condition)
* [Videos](#video)

## We added support for Shadow DOM {#add-shadow-dom-support}

See examples [in tests](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/blob/master/src/test/java/integration/ShadowElementTest.java):

```java
$(shadowCss("#anyButton", "#shadow-host")).click();

$(shadowCss("p", "#shadow-host")).shouldHave(text("Inside Shadow-DOM"));

$(shadowCss("p", "#shadow-host", "#inner-shadow-host")).shouldHave(text("The Shadow-DOM inside another shadow tree"));
```

_Firefox_: Calling `setValue("text")` / `val("text")` on an input field will result in an error, saying that the element is "not reachable by keyboard".   
Temporary workaround for now is to use `fastSetValue=true`:

```java
Configuration.fastSetValue = true;
$(shadowCss("input", "#shadow-host")).setValue("test");
```

## Selenide does not fetch BrowserUpProxy by default {#exclude-bup-by-default}

Taking those two facts into account:
1. Selenide fetches BrowserUpProxy and all its transitive dependencies - it's about ~17MB in total.
2. Most of Selenide users (I guess) do not use Selenide proxy.

we decided to avoid fetching those 17 megabytes by default.

### The dependency
Those of you who wants to use proxy just need to add a dependency to your project:

```groovy
testRuntime 'com.browserup:browserup-proxy-core:2.0.1'
```

(many of you already have it anyway).

Don't worry if you forget to add the dependency - you will see a clear error message like this:

```java
java.lang.IllegalStateException: Cannot initialize proxy. Probably you should add BrowserUpProxy dependency to your project.
    at com.codeborne.selenide.drivercommands.CreateDriverCommand.createDriver(CreateDriverCommand.java:44)
    ...
    at com.codeborne.selenide.Selenide.open(Selenide.java:41)
caused by: java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: com/browserup/bup/BrowserUpProxy
```

See [issue 1021](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1021) and [PR 1094](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1094).

**UPD 12.03.2023**
Nowadays we don't need to add that dependency anymore. Just use `com.codeborne:selenide-proxy` instead of `com.codeborne:selenide`.
It will add all needed dependencies automatically.

### Just in case

Probably you feel curious who eats those 17 megabytes? Here they are.    
This is the list of files that should disappear from your project. The list is impressive, right?

## Migrated Guava API to corresponding Java API {#replace-guava}

We just changed 
* `com.google.common.base.Predicate` from Guava 
* to `java.util.function.Predicate` from Java 8 

and removed Guava dependency. It was great (until Java 8 was released), rip.

If you occasionally implemented your own `CollectionCondition`, you will need to rename `apply` to `test`. It must be easy.

## We made Selenide Allure report a little nicer {#add-quotes-to-report}

We actually just added quotes around selectors in the Allure report.  
Now you can copy selectors from the report and paste into browser's developer console (though, I cannot imagine why somebody should do it).  

See [issue 1032](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1032).

## We added condition `$("img").shouldBe(image)` {#add-image-condition}

You can use it to check that image was successfully loaded.  

See examples [in tests](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/blob/master/src/test/java/integration/ImageTest.java):

```java
$("#valid-image img").shouldBe(image);
$("#valid-image").shouldNotBe(image);
$("h1").shouldNotBe(image);
```

## We fixed find element by attribute which contains quites {#fix-search-by-attribute-with-quotes}

For some reason, people sometimes put quotes inside attributes.  
When trying to find an element by such an attribute, Selenide generated an invalid CSS locator.  
Now we fixed it. 

See [issue 1060](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1060).

## Videos {#video}

Did you think that probably SeleniumCamp 2020 is The Last Conference on Earth? 

Because of quarantine, they have published all [SeleniumCamp 2020 videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLa7q-VITePQWDxFmiDrwlBZ1E9k_nnqLe).   

Among others, this playlist contains my 3 videos (sorry, they are in Russian):
* [Flaky tests: The method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MfMtky-0q4&list=PLa7q-VITePQWDxFmiDrwlBZ1E9k_nnqLe&index=35)
* [BOF: Glorious past and promising future of Selenide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmaTYY3B-Wg&list=PLa7q-VITePQWDxFmiDrwlBZ1E9k_nnqLe&index=41)
* [Threesome: Selenide for Web, Android and iOS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vI4Z6sE7OA&list=PLa7q-VITePQWDxFmiDrwlBZ1E9k_nnqLe&index=16)
