### Un-hang hanging webdriver {#fix-hanging-webdriver}

In Selenide 6.16.0 ([PR 2358](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2358)), we occasionally introduced a bug that 
caused webdriver hanging in some situations.
More exactly, if you call `open(url, pageClass)` twice, then webdriver hangs forever.

Wow. :)

```java
  @Test
  public void this_snippet_hangs() {
    Selenide.open("https://www.google.com/", GooglePage.class);
    Selenide.open("https://www.google.com/", GooglePage.class);
  }
```

In fact, I found that this is [a bug in webdriver](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/issues/12576), 
because it's [reproducible](https://github.com/asolntsev/selenium-deadlock) with pure Selenium. 
And changes in Selenide 6.16.0 just made it _easily reproducible_. 

Now we fixed this problem for most users (but not for all).  
We will wait for the full fix on webdriver side. 

See [issue 2424](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/2424) and [PR 2428](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2428).

> Huge thans for [extryd](https://github.com/extryd) for a concise problem description with steps to reproduce.
Such a description is an invaluable help to maintainers. I wish all tickets were like this!

### Added support for `$.type()` in mobile apps {#support-type-in-mobile-apps}

In a previous release, we added method `type`:
```java
  $.type("Type me slowly with delays");
```
that types the text slowly, with delays. Useful for testing autocompletion, search etc.

But it turned out that it didn't work in mobile apps ([selenide-appium](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/tree/main/modules/appium)). Now it will work. 

See [issue](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2191#issuecomment-1667578383) and [PR 2408](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2408).

### Fixed method `$.type(Keys.*)` {#fix-type-with-keys}

The abovementioned method `type` method accepts not only strings, but also `CharSequence`.
Which means this code should also work:
```java
  import org.openqa.selenium.Keys;

  $("input").type(Keys.ENTER);
```

But it was broken because tried to case `Keys.ENTER` (which is `CharSequence`) to type `String`. 
Now it works (though it's still not clear why it might be useful). 

Thanks to [Oleg Berezhnoy](https://github.com/bereg2k) for observation and [issue 2422](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/2422).  
Fixed in [PR 2421](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2421).

### Removed leading/trailing spaces from `$$.texts()` {#remove-spaces-from-texts}

In Selenide 6.16.0, we [accelerated work with collections](/2023/07/02/selenide-6.16.0/#speedup-collection-checks) with a help of JavaScript code.   
But abovementioned [Oleg Berezhnoy](https://github.com/bereg2k) revealed that we occasionally changes the behaviour of method 
`$$.texts()`. Before, it returned texts of elements without leading and trailing spaces:

```java
  assertThat($$(".burnees").texts()).isEqualTo(List.of(
    "SIG",
    "Olenegorsky Gornyak",
    "Air base Soltsy",
    "Chongar bridges",
    "Henichesk Bridge"
  ));
```

And starting from 6.16.0, it returned texts with leading/trailing spaces:
```java
  assertThat($$(".burnees").texts()).isEqualTo(List.of(
    "  SIG   ",
    "    Olenegorsky Gornyak   ",
    "       Air base Soltsy      ",
    "          Chongar bridges       ",
    "              Henichesk Bridge       "
  ));
```

This is perhaps a disputable which one is correct, but this is how the standard `WebElement.getText()` method works.
So we didn't argue. Now `$$.texts()` trims head and tail spaces again.

See [issue 2419](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/2419) and [PR 2427](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2427).
