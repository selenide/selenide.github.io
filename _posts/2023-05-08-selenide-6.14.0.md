Good evening!

Good news: we have released [Selenide 6.14.0](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/milestone/181?closed=1).

It contains some changes that look minor, but might break something in your tests.
_That's why I highly recommend to **upgrade now**_

* [Sped up debugging](#speedup-debug)
* [Removed flag `--no-sandbox`](#remove-flag--no-sandbox)
* [Added method `step` for reports](#add-step-method)
* [Added method `$.dragAndDrop(DragAndDropOptions)`](#drag-and-drop-with-options)
* [Browser out of screen](#allow-negative-browser-position)
* [Updated dependencies](#update-dependencies)
* [News](#news)
* [Statistics](#statistics)

### Speed up debugging {#speedup-debug}

When you are debugging a test and stop at a breakpoint, sometimes IDE is rendering very slowly page object fields. 
In this state IDE can hang for quite a long time: 

<img src="{{ BASE_PATH }}/images/2023/05/selenide-debug.slow.png" alt="Selenide. debug. slow." width="600px">

The reason is that Selenide makes multiple webdriver calls trying to get elements' tag names, texts and attributes. 
As a result, you will see the most actual detailed information after some time: 

<img src="{{ BASE_PATH }}/images/2023/05/selenide-debug.slow.result.png" alt="Selenide. debug. slow. result."  width="600px">

Now this process will be significantly faster. Selenide will not call webdriver anymore, but just show locator:  

<img src="{{ BASE_PATH }}/images/2023/05/selenide-debug.fast.png" alt="Selenide. debug. slow. result."  width="600px">

But be informed that format of `$.toString()` / `$$.toString()` will change. Who knows, probably it might break your tests.

See [issue 2253](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/2253).
and [PR 2269](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2269).

> But don't worry, it's all only about debugging.
> In case of test failure, you will still receive the full element information with blackjack and screenshooters.

### Removed Chrome argument `--no-sandbox` {#remove-flag--no-sandbox}

I personally don't see any difference, whether I run tests with or without this argument.

But
1. Some users complain that Chrome cannot start in Docker _without_ argument `--no-sandbox`;
2. Other users complain that Chrome, when started _with_ argument `--no-sandbox`, doesn't stop - and chrome process hangs forever in background and eats CPU. But it seems to happen only on Windows (?)

After years of hesitations, we decided to remove this argument `--no-sandbox` by default.
Users of type #1
* can easily detect the problem (chrome wont start)
* can easily add this argument in their tests:
```java
Configuration.browserCapabilities = 
    new ChromeOptions().addArguments("--no-sandbox");
```

See [issue 2270](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/2270) and [PR 2271](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2271).

### Added method `step` for reports {#add-step-method}

If you use Selenide built-in report (`TextReport`), now you can group actions using new method `step`:

```java
@Test
void authentication() {
  step("login",()->{
    open("/login.asp");
    $("#username").val("u");
    $("#password").val("p");
  });

  step("logout",()->{
    $("#logout").click();
    $("#goodBye").shouldHave(text("Good bye looser!"));
  });
}
```

These "steps" will be visually distinguished in the report: 
```text
+---------------+-----------------------------------------------+-------+------+
| Element       |Subject                                        |Status | ms.  |
+---------------+-----------------------------------------------+-------+------+
| login         |                                               |PASS   | 4000 |
|    open       | http://127.0.0.1:8080/my_account/account.html |PASS   | 2662 |
|    #username  | val "u"                                       |PASS   | 300  |
|    #password  | val "p"                                       |PASS   | 400  |
| logout        |                                               |PASS   | 1023 |
|    #logout    | click                                         |PASS   | 923  |
|    #goodBye   | should have text "Good bye looser!"           |PASS   | 100  |
+---------------+-----------------------------------------------+-------+------+
```

By the way, those steps can be embedded into each other.

### Added method `$.dragAndDrop(DragAndDropOptions)` with options {#drag-and-drop-with-options}

Now method `$.dragAndDrop` acquired a more logical sound: first "what", then "where" and finally, "how". 

```java
$("#drag1").dragAndDrop(to("#div2"));
$("#drag1").dragAndDrop(to("#div2").usingJS());
```

Thanks to [Maksim @Au6ojlut](https://github.com/Au6ojlut) for [PR 2245](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2245).

### Allow to set browser position out of screen {#allow-negative-browser-position}

We fixed a minor bug that didn't allow setting negative values to browser position:

```java
Configuration.browserPosition = "-1900x-450";
```

I have no idea why this might be useful, but now it's possible.

See [issue 2258](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/2258) and [PR 2259](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2259).

### Allow setting path to Edge browser binary {#support-edge-binary-location}

Selenide has setting `Configuration.browserBinary` that allows you set path to browser binary
(just in case: in most cases, you _don't need to set it_).

Previously, this setting was not supported for Edge browser. Now it's supported. 

Thanks to [Vladislav Velichko](https://github.com/vlad8x8) for [PR 2267](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2267).
