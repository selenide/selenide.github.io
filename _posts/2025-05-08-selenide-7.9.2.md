### Fixed colors on video {#fix-color-on-video}

In November, we added [video recorder](/2024/11/24/selenide-7.6.0/#video-recorder) to Selenide.
This is an insanely useful feature for [debugging tests](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TvVCxmb9ss&ab_channel=EpicHey%21Conference), 
but turns out the generated videos had some color defects. 

#### Before
On the left, there is the original web page. On the right - how it looked in videos:

<img src="{{ BASE_PATH }}/images/2025/05/selenide.video-recorder.before.png" width="800" alt="colors in video: before"/>

Some colors have been changed, while others stayed the same. Possibly that’s why this issue went unnoticed for a while.   

#### After
How the video looks like AFTER the fix:

<img src="{{ BASE_PATH }}/images/2025/05/selenide.video-recorder.after.png" width="800" alt="colors in video: after"/>

Still not perfect, but **the colors are fixed**.

The only thing I had to do is changing one tiny `true` to `false`. ¯¯\_(ツ)_/¯¯

_Can you guess which exactly?_

See [issue 2973](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/2973) and [PR 3024](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/3024).

### Optimized video recorder {#optimize-video-recorder}

Now video recorder will consume significantly less CPU. 

The initial implementation of video recorder started rendering video _immediately after test start_. 
But in most cases, the test stays green, and the video file gets removed. 

Now video recorder will only take screenshots and store them to a temporary folder during the test.
And only if the test fails, video rendering will be started.

**Pros**: Lower CPU usage  
**Cons**: the final video will be ready a bit later. 

See [issue 3022](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/3022) and [PR 3024](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/3024).

<br>

### Attach video files {#attach-video-recordings}

In the previous release, we added [logging of screenshots](/2025/04/19/selenide-7.9.0/#screenshots-as-attachment) 
in format `[[ATTACHMENT|screenshot.png]]`, which is readable by GitLab and Jenkins (at least).

Now video files will be logged in the same manner:
```
[[ATTACHMENT|/projects/magura/build/reports/tests/1746735811373.0.webm]]
```

At least GitLab and Jenkins will automatically attach these files to build results.

See [issue 2992](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/2992) and [PR 3024](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/3024).

### Updated to Selenium 4.32.0 {#update-to-selenium-4.32.0}

Here is [changelog]({{site.SELENIUM_CHANGELOG}}), including:

* Updated Selenium from 4.31.0 to 4.32.0
* Updated CDP from 135 to 136

See [PR 3020](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/3020).

<br>

### Fixed ClassCastException {#fix-class-cast-in-selenide-appium}

Fixed ClassCastException in module `selenide-appium`.
It happened if you added dependency `selenide-appium` (writing tests for mobile apps), but opened a web browser and 
called `$.scroll(ScrollOptions)`. 

See [issue 3014](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/3014) and [PR 3015](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/3015).

<br>


### Slightly improved loops performance {#improve-loops-performance}

Thanks to [Luis Serna](https://github.com/LuisOsv) for [PR 3013](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/3013).
