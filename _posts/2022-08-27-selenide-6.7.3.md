# Good saturday!

<br>
You are reading release notes for [Selenide 6.7.3](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/milestone/163?closed=1).

### Added condition `partialValue` {#condition-partial-value}

Similarly to `$.shouldHave(partialText("Good Co"))`, now you have  теперь появилась и `$.shouldHave(partialValue("Cola"))`.

It's needed if you set `Configuration.textCheck = FULL_TEXT`, but need to check a value of some input or textarea _partially_.

See [issue 1923](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1923) and [PR 1924](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1924).

<br>

### Added condition `tagName` {#condition-tag-name}

You probably don't need it often. Because we often find element by the tag, and only then verify some its attributes.

Anyway, now you can verify the tag name of an element:

`$(".btn-primary").shouldHave(tagName("button"));`

Or filter a collection by tag name:

`$$(byText("Submit!")).filterBy(tagName("button"));`

See [issue 1928](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1928) and [PR 1929](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1929).

<br/>

### Now we check that element is `<select>` {#check-select-tag}

... in methods `$.getSelectedText()` and `getSelectedValue()`.

The initial intention of these methods was to find a selected `<option>` in a `<select>` and return its text or value.

But
1. it's not obvious from the name (and that's why we renamed methods to `$.getSelectedOptionText()` and `getSelectedOptionValue()`)
2. you could call these methods on any other element but `<select>` - and get an unpredictable behavior.

Now call to `$("div").getSelectedOptionText()` will throw `IllegalArgumentException`.

See [PR 1934](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1934).
