# Bad morning!

While the world is going crazy, we are releasing [Selenide 6.8.0](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/milestone/161?closed=1).  
Not so many features, rather dependency updates. 

* [Recursive search in shadow dom](#deep-shadow-selectors)
* [Method page() without parameters](#add-page-without-class)
* [Annotation @As](#as-annotation)

### Recursive search in shadow dom {#deep-shadow-selectors}

As you probably know, Selenide has [methods](/2020/03/18/selenide-5.10.0) to find elements inside shadow dom. 
And even in multiple embedded shadow doms:

```java
$(shadowCss("#reportButton", 
     "#shadow-host", "#inner-shadow-host")).click();
```

But you still need to waste time to investigate these doms and find proper locators for all those shadow roots.

Now you can save time with the help of new method `shadowDeepCss` - it searches the element recursively in all shadow roots all over the dom. 

```java
$(shadowDeepCss("#reportButton")).click();
```

Naturally, there is still a risk that such "too generic" search can find a wrong element which probably resides in 
another shadow dom, but occasionally matches your locator.  
In this case you will need to return to the old good "exact" search.  

> As in the case of databases and sausages, "it's better not to look inside" - there is a bunch of tricky javascript for tree search.

   project [query-selector-shadow-dom](https://github.com/Georgegriff/query-selector-shadow-dom), from where we stole this code. :)

### Added method `page()` not requiring `Class` argument {#add-page-without-class}

Dear Page Object fans, take a seat, this is for you. There is a turning point in your life.

Now you don't need to pass `Class` argument to method `page(Class pageObjectClass)`. Wow!

Instead of
```java
SelectsPage page = page(SelectsPage.class);
```

you can just write
```java
SelectsPage page = page();
```

I used to think Java couldn't do that, but then I found [a hack](https://twitter.com/tagir_valeev/status/1262763570904719361).

See [PR 1961](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1961),
and thanks to [Tagir Valeev](https://twitter.com/tagir_valeev) for the hack.

### Added annotation `@As` {#as-annotation}
... for giving human-readable aliases for page object fields.

#### 1. Without aliases
Assuming you have a page object with `@FindBy` annotations:
```java
class PageObject {
  @FindBy(xpath="//table/div[3]/span[4]/h1")
  SelenideElement header;
}
```
and a test like `page.header.shouldBe(visible)`.

In reports, it looks quite long and unreadable:
```text
| open                                  | https://devclub.eu  | PASS  |
| By.xpath: //table/div[3]/span[4]/h1   | should be(visible)  | FAIL  |
```

And when the test fails, it's quite hard to understand which element was not found:
```java
Element not found {By.xpath: //table/div[3]/span[4]/h1}
```

People often want to give some human-readable names to elements to avoid seeing long ugly xpath's in reports.

#### 2. Resistance
I have always been against it.
I believe that not only reports, but also the tests themselves should be readable. I stand for clean code.
If you don't like the ugly xpath - well, just change it, don't hide it!

But still decided to meet people's need.
In [Selenide 5.17.0](/2020/12/26/selenide-5.17.0/), we added method `$.as("alias")`. 

#### 3. With aliases

And in this release you can also add annotation `@As` to page object fields. 

```java
class PageObject {
  @As("Large header")
  @FindBy(xpath="//table/div[3]/span[4]/h1")
  SelenideElement header1;
}
```

It will look readable in reports:
```text
| open           | https://devclub.eu   | PASS   |
| Large header   | should be(visible)   | FAIL   |
```

And when the test fails, it's easier to understand which element was not found:
```java
Element "Large header" not found {By.xpath: //table/div[3]/span[4]/h1}
```
See [issue 1903](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1903) and [PR 1956](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1956).

> Don't forget: everyone lies.
>
> Documentation lies, comments lie, users lie.
> Sooner or later, the alias will also lie. Someone changed the locator, but forgot the alias. 
> Or the element was copied, but the alias was forgotten to be changed. Etc.
>
> Reports are good, but in the end, only the code can be trusted.
