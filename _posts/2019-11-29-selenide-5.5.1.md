Hi all!

At Black Friday, we released [Selenide 5.5.1](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/milestone/86?closed=1) with a couple of new features.

* [Mobile browser emulation](#mobile-browser-emulation)
* [Deprecated method `Selenide.close()`](#deprecated-selenide-close)
* [News](#news)

# We added mobile browser emulation {#mobile-browser-emulation}

Sometimes you want to run browser not on a usual Chrome, but on Chrome "like in mobile".

Like you would open a browser in mobile phone or tablet. 

(For example, site selenide.org looks ugly on mobile. :( We are working on it.)

Now it's easy to do it by adding a System property before running tests:

```java
java -Dchromeoptions.mobileEmulation="deviceName=Nexus 5"
```

or right in your code: 

```java
System.setProperty("chromeoptions.mobileEmulation", "deviceName=Nexus 5");
```

NB! We are talking only about one setting - a device name. It should be enough in most cases.
If you need to tune other mobile browser settings, please implement `WebDriverProvider` interface.

See [issue 1008](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1008) and [PR 1011](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1011).

# We deprecated method `Selenide.close()` {#deprecated-selenide-close}

Selenide always had method `Selenide.close()`. But its name is misleading: it closes the whole browser, not only a current window.
The problem is that Selenium Webdriver also has method `close()` which only closes a current window/tab (and the whole browser only if it was the only window/tab).
And for closing the whole browser Selenium has method `quit()`. 

It was my fault that I created method `close()` without reading Selenium documentation. I was young and didn't believe in Javadoc. :)
But part of the problem is that Selenium names `close` vs `quit` are not intuitive. Go figure which of them closes what.

To make your life easier, we now suggest two method with explicit names:
* `Selenide.closeWindow()` - closes a current window (or tab, which is the same)
* `Selenide.closeWebDriver()` - closes the whole browser

Now you don't need to remember anything.

The old method `Selenide.close()` is now deprecated. Going to delete it in Selenide 6.0.0

See [issue 1016](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1016) and [PR 1017](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1017).
