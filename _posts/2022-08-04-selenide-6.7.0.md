# Good day!

<br>
We've got a big release [Selenide 6.7.0](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/milestone/154?closed=1)

### Now `$.shouldHave(text)` can verify the whole text {#holy-whole-string}

From the very beginning, command `$.shouldHave(text)` verified the text _partially_, not the whole text:

```html
  <div id="freedom-to">Britney Spears</div>
```

```java
  $("#freedom-to").shouldHave(text("Brit"));  // was OK
```

Initially, this seemed like a good idea, because a web page often contains all sorts of inconsiderable/invisible characters.
(newlines, tab characters, non-portable spaces, multiple spaces, etc.).

But now it seems that it was still a bad idea, because beginners assume by default that the text is verified entirely, and
snatch their portion of WTF moments when they discover that all their checks were checking a little wrong. :)

And Selenide learned to ignore differences in the inconsiderable characters (for example, multiple subsequent spaces/tabs/newlines are considered as a single space).

NB! Since this change is too drastic and will probably break a bunch of your tests, we left the previous behaviour as a default.
And the new one can be enabled with this setting:

```java
  Configuration.textCheck = FULL_TEXT;
```

And when you need to check a substring, you can use the new check `partialText`:
```java
  $("#freedom-to").shouldHave(partialText("ey Spear"))
```

Perhaps we will enable this mode by default in the next major version of Selenide 7.0.0 - until then
**you can play around and give us feedback**.

See [issue 1780](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1780) and [PR 1783](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1783).

### Full-size screenshots {#full-size-screenshots}

Finally!

Now Selenide can take full-size screenshots.

When a test fails, Selenide automatically takes a screenshot to help you understand why the test failed.
By default, the webdriver captures only the visible part, not the entire browser window. But the most important things
are often located outside the screen. The test failure is often caused by some disabled button at the bottom of the
screen or a pop-up notification somewhere in the corner.

Now you can apply a plugin that takes a screenshot with the full content of a web page in one line:

```groovy
testImplementation "com.codeborne:selenide-full-screenshot:6.7.0"
```

P.S. This plugin works only in browser supporting CDP (Chrome, Edge etc.) and Firefox.
In other browsers, Selenide will take standard screenshots as usually.

See [issue 1799](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1799) and [PR 1858](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1858).
Thanks to [Aliaksandr Rasolka](https://github.com/rosolko) for [PR 1800](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1800).

### Caching of page object elements {#cache-lookup-annotation}

As you know, Selenide supports "standard" Selenium page objects with annotations like `@FindBy`.
But one specific annotation `@CacheLookup` was not supported by Selenide.
It seemed an unneeded optimization because during test run, most of the time is usually spent on other things.

Now we support the caching, why not. Who knows, probably has so much optimized project that the search of web elements
became a bottleneck. I would like to see such a project. :)

Thanks to [Ilya Koshaleu](https://github.com/groov1kk) for [PR 1894](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1894).

P.S. The question arises, should we also add caching for regular `$` and `$$` as well.
What should be the api: a parameter, a setting? New method?

**Suggest your ideas!**

### Cancelled TestNG annotation `@Report` {#cancel-report-testng-annotation}

Now the cancel culture has reached the annotations!

If you use TestNG and Selenide text report, this announce is for you. Until now, you had to add 2 annotations
to your tests:

```java
  @Listeners({TextReport.class})
  @Report
  class MyTest {...}
``` 

Why we did this is a long story about the clumsy principles of how listeners work in TestNG
(in short: adding a listener annotation to one class suddenly affects all other classes).
But now we realized that the system can be simplified: the `@Report` annotation is no longer needed.

Now Selenide report will be generated for all tests annotated with `@Listeners({TextReport.class}` **and their child classes**.

See [issue 1891](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1891) and [PR 1909](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1909).

### Decode downloaded file name {#decode-downloaded-file-name}

It turned out that when downloading a file, the file name in the server response is sometimes encoded in Base64.
And Selenide was reading this encoded file name as is. Now Selenide decrypts the file name.

See [issue 1886](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1886) and [PR 1889](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1889).

<br>

### Fixed `$.setValue()` in IE {#restore-ie-support-set-value}

It turns out we recently broke the `$.setValue()` method in Internet Explorer.
We assumed people don't use IE anymore: IE has officially given up. But there were complaints, and we restored IE support.

See [PR 1907](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1907).

<br>

### Made `HttpClientTimeouts` public {#made-http-client-timeouts-public}

See [PR 1902](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1902).

<br>

### Returned parameter type to `String` for method `$.setValue()` {#restore-set-value-string}

Personally, it burns me from the fact that such a problem arose at all.

See details in [issue 1885](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1885) and [PR 1888](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1888).

<br>

### Added a warning about invalid file extension parameter {#validate-file-extension}

See [PR 1887](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1887).
