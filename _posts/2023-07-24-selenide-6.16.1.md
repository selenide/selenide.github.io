Hello, people!

We released a small update [Selenide 6.16.1](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/milestone/186?closed=1).

* [Added conditions `allOf` and `anyOf`](#all-of-and-any-of-conditions)
* [Added checks for cookies](#add-checks-for-cookies)
* [Updated WebDriverManager](#update-webdrivermanager)
* [Fixed support for `<tspan>` in SVG](#support-tspan-in-svg)

### Added conditions `allOf` and `anyOf` {#all-of-and-any-of-conditions}

Now you can check one of conditions (OR):

```java
$("#president").shouldHave(anyOf(text("Lowlife"), text("Cowardly bum")));
```

(in fact, Selenide already had method `Condition.or` for the same purpose, but `anyOf` seems to be easier to use).

Also, you can check all conditions (AND):

```java
$("#president").shouldHave(allOf(text("a catastrophic character"), text("another six years of this cowardly bum in power")));
```

(in fact, it's the same as just `$("#president").shouldHave(text(..), text(..))`, 
but the result of `allOf` can be extracted to a variable or method and reused, thus creating your own DSL).

Thanks to [Evgenii Plugatar](https://github.com/evpl) and [PR 2368](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2368).

### Added checks for cookies {#add-checks-for-cookies}

Now you can check cookies in browser:

```java
import static com.codeborne.selenide.Selenide.webdriver;

webdriver().shouldHave(cookie("session_id"));
webdriver().shouldHave(cookie("session_id", "1234567890"));
webdriver().shouldHave(cookie("session_id", "1234567890", Duration.ofSeconds(10)));
```

With built-in waiting, custom timeout, automated screenshot - everything you like. 

Thanks to [adorne](https://github.com/adorne) for [PR 2367](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2367).

<br>

### Updated WebDriverManager from 5.4.0 to 5.4.1 {#update-webdrivermanager}

Among others, it has support for Chrome 115 which caused a problem for many users. 

See [PR 2374](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2374).

P.S. On macOS, Chrome 115 still causes a error:

```
SessionNotCreatedException: Could not start a new session.  
  Response code 500.  
    Message: unknown error: cannot find Chrome binary 
```

It's a known [chromedriver bug](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/chrome-for-testing/issues/30). They promised to fix it soon.

### Fixed support for `<tspan>` in SVG {#support-tspan-in-svg}

Have you ever checked texts inside SVG? Me neither. And it turns out SVG can contain texts!

```xml
  <svg>
    <text x="10" y="30" class="small">
      People want to see <tspan>gratitude</tspan>.
    </text>
  
    <text x="10" y="60" class="small">
      We are not <tspan>Amazon</tspan> warehouse.
    </text>
  
    <text x="10" y="90" class="small">
      Thank you, <tspan>Ben Wallace</tspan>!
    </text>
  </svg>
```

Now you can check these texts again:
```java
  $$("svg tspan").shouldHave(texts("gratitude", "Amazon", "Ben Wallace"));
```

See [issue 2377](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/2377) and [PR 2379](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/2379).
